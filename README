This directory contains the releases of the pmindia corpus. It is a parallel corpus containing 13 Indian languages, plus English, derived from the Prime Minister of India's news updates (https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news-updates/). We release a sentence aligned version of the corpus, as well as the monolingual text extracted from the articles.
The code for crawling and aligning is available at https://github.com/bhaddow/pmindia-crawler. Version 1b fixes the alignment problem for bs-en and as-en.
