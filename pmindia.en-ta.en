“I will be visiting Buenos Aires from 29 November -01 December 2018 to attend the 13th G-20 Summit hosted by Argentina.
The G-20 seeks to promote multi-faceted cooperation among the twenty largest economies of the world.
Through the ten years of its existence, G-20 has strived to promote stable and sustainable global growth.
This objective is of particular significance for developing countries and emerging economies such as India, which is today the fastest growing large economy in the world.
India’s contribution to global economic growth and prosperity underlines our commitment to “Building Consensus for Fair and Sustainable Development”, which is the theme of the Summit.
 
I will highlight the need for reformed multilateralism which reflects the contemporary realities and can effectively strengthen collective action for global good.
There is also a serious need to strengthen international cooperation and enhance coordinated action against fugitive economic offenders and financing of terrorism.

He observed that girls born in villages of Haryana are making the country proud in the global arena, and the youth of Haryana is helping make India a global sports power.
Indian IT talent has been recognized worldwide.
Indian IT companies have made a name for themselves globally.
Today, digital technology has emerged as a great enabler.
It has paved the way for efficient service delivery and governance.
Technology breaks barriers.
We believe it validates the Indian philosophy of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” – the world is one family.
We in India, give primacy to the human face of technology, and are using it to improve what I call, “ease of living.”
Empowerment through digital access, is an objective that the Government of India is especially committed to.
“Digital India” is the world’s largest, technology-led transformative programme which is paving the way for our citizens to avail digital services.
We are using mobile power or M-power to empower our citizens.
I am sure most of you are already aware of Aadhaar, which is the unique biometric identity of a person.
We have used this identity to liberate our people from queues and cumbersome processes.
Three factors: first, financial inclusion through our Jan-Dhan bank accounts; second, the Aadhaar platform; and third, the Mobile phone, have greatly helped reduce corruption.
We call this the J.A.M. or JAM trinity.
Through better targeting of subsidies, the JAM trinity has prevented leakages to the tune of nearly 10 billion dollars so far.
Let me share a few examples of how digital technology is becoming a great facilitator for “ease of living.”
Today, a farmer can access a variety of services, such as soil-testing results, expert advice, and a good price for his produce, at the click of a button.
Digital technology is therefore contributing to increased farm incomes.
A small entrepreneur can register on the Government e-Marketplace, and bid competitively for supply of goods to the Government.
As he expands his business, he also contributes to lowering the cost of procurement for Government.
This leads to increased efficiency, and greater value for public money.
Pensioners no longer need to present themselves in front of a bank officer, to provide proof of life.
Today, a pensioner can leverage the Aadhaar biometric platform, to provide this proof with minimal physical effort.
Women form a significant part of the IT workforce.
Digital technology has facilitated several new enterprises led by women.
In this way the IT sector has contributed towards gender empowerment.
We are using the digital domain to facilitate participative governance, or Jan Bhagidari.
When we assumed office in May 2014, many people, particularly youngsters expressed a keen desire to share their ideas and work for the nation.
It is our firm belief that there are millions of Indians, whose transformative ideas can go a long way in taking India to new heights.
Therefore, we launched the citizen engagement portal, MyGov.
This platform enables citizens to share their thoughts and ideas on important issues.
In many key policy areas, we received thousands of valuable suggestions.
Many logo and emblem designs for various Government initiatives today, are the result of crowd-sourcing, and competitions on MyGov.
On assuming office, I realized that important government projects and initiatives often suffer on account of unnecessary silos in government functioning, and the lack of focused decision-making.
Therefore, we devised a cyberspace based platform, called PRAGATI or Proactive Governance for Timely Implementation.
PRAGATI, in Hindi, literally means progress.
On the last Wednesday of every month, I meet top Union and State government officials for a PRAGATI Session.
Technology breaks silos.
Sitting in our respective offices, aided by the cyber world, we discuss and resolve important governance issues.
I am happy to share with you that the PRAGATI sessions have resulted in faster decision-making, through consensus, in the larger interest of the nation.
PRAGATI has put back on track infrastructure projects worth billions of dollars which were stuck in red-tape.
I have even tried something of my own, through the Narendra Modi Mobile App.
This App deepens my connect with citizens.
The suggestions I get through the App are very useful.
Today, we launched the UMANG Mobile App, which will provide over a hundred citizen-centric services.
At the back-end, these services will be catered for by many different departments of the Union and State Governments.
This integrated approach will add an automatic layer of “peer performance pressure”, in the working of these departments.
We shall be happy to share our experiences and success stories with the global community.
On the other hand, India is keen to find scalable models and innovative solutions in education and health, using digital technology.
We also wish to make cyberspace an enabler for the differently-abled.
Recently, during a thirty six hour Hackathon, college students suggested solutions to chronic problems that were put forward by Ministries.
We look forward to learn from global experiences and best practices.
We believe that growth happens only when we all grow together.
Cyberspace remains a key area for innovation.
The internet, by nature, is inclusive and not exclusive.
It offers equity of access, and equality of opportunity.
Today’s discourse is being shaped by Facebookers, Tweeples, and Instagrammers.
Social media platforms are making cyberspace participative for all.
News that experts tell us from studios, is now supplemented by experiences highlighted on social media.
This transition, to a blend of expertise and experience, is the contribution of the cyber world.
The theme of the Conference: “Secure and Inclusive Cyberspace for Sustainable Development” also highlights the importance of securing this vital asset for mankind.
We need to ensure that vulnerable sections of our society do not fall prey to the evil designs of cyber criminals.
Alertness towards cyber-security concerns, should become a way of life.
One of the major focus areas should be the training of well-equipped and capable professionals to counter cyber threats.
Cyber-warriors who will remain on the alert against cyber-attacks.
The term “hacking” may have acquired an exciting, even if dubious overtone.
On a related note, nations must also take responsibility to ensure that the digital space does not become a playground for the dark forces of terrorism and radicalization.
Information sharing and coordination among security agencies is essential to counter the ever-changing threat landscape.
Surely, we can walk the fine balance between privacy and openness on one hand, and national security on the other.
Together, we can overcome the differences between global and open systems on one hand, and nation-specific legal requirements on the other.
Emerging digital technologies could impact our future in ways that we cannot yet foresee.
Important questions of transparency, privacy, trust and security may need to be addressed.
Digital technology serves to empower mankind.
We must ensure that it continues to stay that way.
The large multi-stakeholder participation at this event, is proof of the global endorsement that this platform has received.
Nation states, the industry, academia and civil society, all need to work towards a formal collaborative framework.
I am told that all the background and logistics have been handled digitally.
I hope delegates from around the world found it a smooth and seamless experience.
I conclude by wishing you fruitful and productive deliberations and outcomes.
I once again welcome you, and wish the conference all success.

Governor of Manipur, Dr. Najma Heptullah,
Chief Minister of Manipur, Shri N. Biren Singh
My ministerial colleague, Dr. Harsh Vardhan,
Other distinguished dignitaries on the dais,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Let me begin by paying my rich tributes to three very distinguished Indian scientists whom we lost in recent times – Padma Vibhushan Prof Yashpal, Padma Vibhushan Prof UR Rao and Padma Shri Dr Baldev Raj.
They all made out-standing contributions to Indian science and education.
It bodes well for the future.
Science has been synonymous with progress and prosperity from time immemorial.
As the best scientific minds of our nation, all of you gathered here today are power-houses of knowledge, innovation and enterprise, and are best equipped to drive this change.
The time is ripe to redefine ‘R&D’ as ‘Research’ for the ‘Development’ of the nation – that is ‘R&D’ in the real sense.
Science is after all, but a means to a far greater end – of making a difference in the lives of others, of furthering human progress and welfare.
The time is also ripe, to commit ourselves to facilitate ‘Ease of Living’ for 125 crore Indians, through the power as well as potential of science and technology.
I stand here today, in this brave land of Manipur, where in April 1944 Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s INA gave the clarion call for freedom.
When you leave Manipur, I am sure you will also carry the same spirit of dedication to do something ever-lasting for our nation.
I am also sure you will continue to work closely with the scientists you have met here.
After all, effective solutions to big problems of science and technology, also require close cooperation and coordination among scientists across diverse streams.
The Union Government has initiated several new programs for the North-Eastern States, in the area of science.
Agro-Meteorological Services are being provided under the ग्रामीणकृषिमौसमसेवा.This is benefiting over five lakh farmers.
An “Ethno Medicinal Research Centre“ has been set up in Manipur.
This will undertake research on the wild herbs available in the North Eastern region, which have unique medicinal and aromatic properties.
State Climate Change Centers have been set up in seven North-Eastern States.
They will undertake risk analysis, and raise public awareness about climate change.
We have freed “bamboo” from being treated as a ‘Tree’ species, and classified it as a “Grass,” which it scientifically is.
For this, we changed a decades old law.
This amendment will allow for the free movement of bamboo.
The Indian Science Congress has a rich legacy.
It has been led by some of India’s tallest scientists, such as Acharya J.C. Bose, C.V. Raman, Meghnad Saha and S.N. Bose.
New India, should seek inspiration from the high standards of excellence, set by these great scientists.
During our interactions on various occasions, I have exhorted our scientists to seek solutions to our socio economic problems.
I have urged them to take up new challenges to benefit the poor and deprived sections of society.
In this context, the theme chosen for the Indian Science Congress this year, is quite appropriate: “Reaching the Unreached through Science and Technology”.
The theme is very close to my heart.
I therefore urge you to direct your research and innovation towards solving the problems of our times and meeting the aspirations of our people.
Scientific Social Responsibility is the need of the hour.
The Session’s theme also raises some questions.
This will help inculcate scientific temper among the youth.
It will also excite and attract our young minds to careers in science.
We have to throw open our national institutions and laboratories to our children.
I call upon scientists to develop an appropriate mechanism for interaction with school-going children.
We are committed to increasing the share of non-fossil fuel based capacity in the electricity mix above 40 per cent by 2030.
India is a leader in the multi-country International Solar Alliance and in Mission Innovation.
This is a major boost to the domestic nuclear industry.
It strengthens India’s credentials as a major nuclear manufacturing nation.
In recent times, CSIR has developed a hand-held milk tester, which helps every family to test quality of milk within seconds.
CSIR has also achieved breakthroughs in developing diagnostic kits for rare genetic diseases and high value aromatic and medicinal plants used by farmers to increase their income.
We are making concerted efforts to achieve complete elimination of TB from India.
A few days ago, at the ‘End TB Summit’ in New Delhi, we demonstrated our commitment to eliminate TB from India by 2025, five years ahead of the WHO target of 2030.
After the success of Chandrayan-1 we plan to launch Chandrayan-2 in the coming months.
This fully indigenous effort will include landing and travel on the surface of the moon by a rover.
The greatest scientist of the last century, Albert Einstein had given the theory about “gravitational waves”.
It is a matter of immense pride for all of us that 37 Indian scientists from nine Indian institutions participated in the international Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) Collaboration and proved this theory correct three years ago.
I am told that our scientists are tirelessly working towards making this a reality.
We have recently approved a new “Prime Minister’s Research Fellows” scheme.
India faces major socio-economic challenges which affect large sections of our population.
We need science and technology to help us make India clean, green and prosperous.
Let me re-iterate some of my expectations from scientists.
A large section of our tribal population is affected by सिकलसेलअनीमिया.
Can our Scientists come up with a simple, cost-effective solution to this problem in the near future?
Your suggestions and solutions can help us meet the objectives of the Mission.
We need a multi-pronged approach including efficient solar and wind power, energy storage and electric mobility solutions, clean cooking, conversion of coal to clean fuels like methanol, cleaner power from coal, smart grids, micro-grids and bio-fuels.
We have set a target of having 100 Giga Watts of installed solar power by 2022.
Imagine the resources we will be saving on this account.
We need to develop new procedures, medicines, and vaccines to get rid of silent killers like Malaria and Japanese Encephalitis.
Research should also be conducted in Yoga, sports, and traditional knowledge disciplines.
Can our scientific and technological institutions take up the cause of the MSME sector and assist these units in improving processes and products?
We have to be future ready in implementing technologies vital for the growth and prosperity of the nation.
Technology will allow far greater penetration of services such as education, healthcare, and banking to our citizens.
Four years from now, we will be celebrating the 75th year of our Independence.
We shall focus on important sectors such as Health and Nutrition; Education; Agriculture and Water Resources; Financial Inclusion; Skill Development; and Basic Infrastructure.
All these sectors require innovative solutions, which cater to local challenges and requirements.
This would be a great service to Mother India.
India has a rich tradition and a long history of both discovery and use science and technology.
It is time to reclaim our rightful place among the front-line nations in this field.
I call upon the scientific community to extend its research from the labs, to the land.
I am confident that through the dedicated efforts of our scientists, we are embarking on the road to a better future.
The future we wish for ourselves, and for our children.

In 2022, India will complete 75 years of independence, the next five years provide an opportunity to plan and build on our achievements, to make a quantum leap in all spheres of development.

In the spirit of सबका साथ, सबका विकास, every Indian, irrespective of caste, gender, religion, class must have equal opportunities to partake in the new prosperity.

I am convinced that States are the main drivers of change.
We have taken a number of initiatives to infuse healthy competition among States.
A Committee of Chief Ministers made recommendations to rationalize Centrally Sponsored Schemes.
We duly accepted the recommendations.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today addressed the Economic Times Global Business Summit.
He said from the days of 2013-14, when India was beset with problems such as runaway inflation, high fiscal deficit and policy paralysis, change is clearly visible today.
Hesitations have been replaced by hope, and obstacles have been replaced by optimism, he said.
The Prime Minister said that since 2014,India has made significant improvements in almost all international rankings and indices.
He said rankings are mostly lagging indicators, which change only after things have changed on the ground.
In this context, he gave the example of Ease of Doing Business, where several parameters have visibly improved.
He said that a perception had been made that governments cannot be pro-growth and pro-poor at the same time,but people of India are making it possible.
In the last four years, the amount of Foreign Direct Investment received in the country was almost equal to what was received in seven years before 2014, the Prime Minister said.
He added that to achieve this, India needed reforms to transform.
Through the Bankruptcy Code, GST, Real Estate Act to name a few, a solid foundation for decades of higher growth has been laid, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said that India is a country of 130 crore aspirations and there can never be a singular vision for development and progress.

44 percent of the startups registered in India are from tier 2 and tier3 cities, he added.

To recall the words of the great saint Thiruvalluvar, “There is nothing in this world except ethics, which would bring both reputation and wealth together”.
Technology has brought about great change in the media.
Renewed emphasis on credibility, brings us to the subject of introspection.
I firmly believe that reform in the media, whenever required, can only come from within, through introspection.
There is another key area, where media can play an important role.
Can a newspaper, devote just a few column inches of space, each day for one year, to this cause?
Every day, they can write one simple sentence in their language of publication, along with its translation, and trans-literation, in all major Indian languages.
Hence, this step will not only serve a noble cause, but will also increase the strength of the publication itself.
Seventy five years may be a considerable amount of time in a human life-span.
But for a nation, or an institution, it marks just a significant milestone.
New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi sat down with Network 18 Group Editor Rahul Joshi for a comprehensive interview covering a multitude of topics spanning politics, economy, the criticism of his government following recent attacks on Dalits, vote bank politics and casteism and also offered a rare peek into himself, his working style and his closely held beliefs.
Appended below is the edited transcript of the interview translated from Hindi into English
Question: At the outset, thank you for giving this interview to Network 18.
Two years ago you were elected with a historic mandate, the most decisive in three decades.
India is a democratic country and the people evaluate governments regularly.
The media also evaluates.
And these days, professional survey agencies also do this.
And I think this is a good thing and that’s why I leave it to the people to evaluate how my government has performed.
But I will definitely want that whenever my government is evaluated, the situation of the government before we came to power must be kept in mind, what the state of the country was, what the media was discussing.
The reason for that is the patient’s inner belief.
My first priority after forming the government was that the atmosphere of despair should be removed and to create hope and belief in the country.
That doesn’t happen with speeches.
Concrete steps need to be taken, it has been shown to be done.
And today after more than two years, I can say with certainty that there is hope not just in the people of this country, the trust of the entire world in India has grown.
There was a time when we were being seen as a sinking ship.
In the BRICS, the ‘I’ (representing India) was seen as wobbly.
Today it is said that if there is a bright spot, it is India.
I think this in itself is a good way to evaluate.
How big a success do you see this.
What does it mean for the common man?
PM Modi: This is perhaps the biggest tax reform since the independence of India.
This reform will bring a big change in India.
Very few people in the country pay taxes.
Some people pay taxes because they are patriotic and they want to do something for the country.
Some pay taxes because they don’t want to break the law.
Some pay to avoid trouble.
But most don’t pay because the process is complicated.
They think they might get stuck in the process and won’t be able to come out.
GST will simplify tax payments so much that anyone who wants to contribute to the country will come forward.
Secondly, today if you go and eat in a hotel, the bill that you get comes with this cess, that cess… People send messages on Whatsapp detailing the bill amount and the cess paid.
All this will end.
When vehicles stand, it hurts the country’s economy.
Now all of it will become seamless, the movement of goods from one state to another.
Taxation systems will also be simplified and this will not only benefit the common man, the revenues will help develop the nation.
Today, there are incidents of mistrust between states.
This will end that situation, it will be transparent and strengthen the federal structure.
Question: After coming to power, your biggest challenge was the economy.
The task before you was not just to bring it back on track but also increase the pace of growth.
Have you managed to achieve this?
PM Modi: You are right that there was a negative atmosphere.
The country’s traders and industrialists had started looking out.
There was a paralysis in government.
Third, there was a slowdown in the global economy.
So there were a series of challenges.
It wasn’t only after we took charge.
There was decisiveness because there was no vested interest.
The result of this was that positivity spread very quickly.
Today, we have the highest amount of foreign direct investment after Independence.
The entire world says that at 7% growth, we are the fastest growing economy.
All obstructions are being removed with policies.
All this has resulted in speeding up the economy.
This time the rains have been good and this helps agriculture, which is driving force for the economy.
This has raised hopes that the coming days will be much better.
Usually it is one or two things that are talked about, but today growth has being talked about in all sectors.
Electricity production has gone up and so has demand.
Infrastructure work is also growing rapidly and that happens when there is demand in the economy.
From all this it looks like we have moved ahead to better days.
Question: You are absolutely right that the monsoon is very encouraging and stock markets are also up.
Can you please tell us what the next wave of reforms will be?
PM Modi: First of all, in our country, only what is talked about is seen as reform.
If it isn’t talked about, it isn’t seen as reform.
It shows our ignorance.
Actually I am of the view reform to transform.
And since I am sitting for an interview, I would say Reform, Perform, Transform and Inform.
Take ease of doing business.
Our ranking is improving very quickly.
This is not possible without reform.
Our systems, processes, forms were so complicated.
These have been reformed, so our rankings are going up.
A UN agency has said that from 10 in the next two years, we could be at number three.
These small things need to be improved.
Even today there exists licence raj in some areas.
That needs to go.
This is an important reform that is happening at every level — administrative, governance, legal.
Like for instance we removed 1,700 laws that were from the 19th and 20th centuries.
I have asked states also to do so.
These are very big reforms that people, because of lack on information, don’t consider reforms.
Take education, where we have taken an important step that no one gave attention to.
This is a major reform, but doesn’t get attention.
Direct benefit transfer is a big reform.
So are gas subsidy payments and student scholarships.
For me all these are reforms in governance, transparency.
We are getting in more technology.
These have to be done at a larger scale.
At the Centre of this is the common man.
How to make life easier for the common man, how they will get what is their right, we want to stress on these.
Question:While there has been economic growth, private investment in the economy is still tepid.
Some sectors like real estate are still in trouble.
Venture capital funding of startups has slowed.
What message would you like to give to private industry and foreign investors at this juncture?
PM Modi: Today I think, before presenting the first Budget, I should have placed a White Paper in Parliament on the economic situation in the country.
This thought had struck me then.
I had two paths then.
Politics told me that I should put out all the details.
But I took the political damage in the country’s interest.
The impact of all these issues from the past have impacted private investment, like the non-performing assets in banks.
I held a session with bankers and told them there will be no call from the government to you.
These steps would have tightened the screws.
And my motto is, as it says on railway platforms: ‘short cut will cut you short’.
We don’t want to take any shortcuts and the results are showing.
Anyway the situation has now improved.
When unbiased people analyse the situation, I am confident they will be surprised.
Question: You have adopted a tough line on Black Money.
In fact, it is said that because of this crackdown on black money, some businessmen are hiding either in Dubai or London.
You haven’t spared political dynasts either.
Will this process continue?
PM Modi: Firstly, I have neither looked at this from a political standpoint and nor will I do so in the future.
I have been a state CM for 14 years.
And history bears witness to the fact that I have never opened any file due to political considerations.
I have never been accused of this either.
It has been over two years here too.
The government has given no instruction to open any file.
The law will take its own course.
I have no right to indulge in any cover up.
You saying that we haven’t spared any dynasty isn’t correct.
“We have made requisite legal changes so that the black money circulating inside the country can also be curbed.
Come into the mainstream.
I have this plan for people to sleep peacefully at night.
People must accept this.
And no one should blame me if I take tough decisions after the 30th.
This is my commitment.
I am working with full force and will continue the effort.
Question: Mr Prime Minister, let us talk about politics.
Many states go to polls next year.
Social discrimination and fundamentalism is raising its ugly head again.
Dalits and members of backward classes have in fact started saying that the BJP and the RSS are anti Dalit.
How will you assure the people that your agenda is development and development alone?
PM Modi: The country has full faith that our agenda is only development.
There is no confusion in the minds of people.
But all those people who never wanted that a government like this to come to power, those who never wanted the previous regime to go… they are the ones who have trouble.
So, development is our only issue and it will remain so.
We will need to empower the poor.
As far as some incidents are concerned, they need to be condemned.
It has no place in any civilised society.
But we must not forget that law and order is a state subject.
Some are selectively picking issues and blaming Modi for it.
I don’t know what purpose does it serve for those who are doing this.
But this is surely hurting the interest of the country.
Such incidents must not happen.
From a statistical point of view, whether it is communal violence, atrocities against Dalits or atrocities against tribals, data shows that such incidents have gone down in number compared with what it was under the previous government.
But the issue is not of what happened in their government and our government.
The issue is that this is not befitting as per our society.
We have a culture dating back thousands of years.
We have seen some imbalances in our society and we have to intelligently take our society out of this imbalance.
It is deeply rooted.
Politics on social imbalances is a disservice to society.
To all those who have faced injustice for generations.
If you look at dalit MPs and dalit MLAs, tribal MPs and tribal MLAs, the BJP has a sizable presence.
I am devoted to the development of all the dalits, oppressed, underprivileged, deprived, women.
Those who see this as an obstruction to their politics are the ones creating trouble.
And this is why they are levelling baseless allegations.
All those who have fed this country the poison of caste divide have destroyed this country.
They must stop giving political tones to social problems.
 
And I want to ask the society also: are these incidents befitting of a civilised society?
I spoke from the ramparts of the Red Fort on the incidents of rape…I said that parents must ask their sons also – where they are going, what they are doing?
We ask our daughters these questions.
And I want to tell this to our politicians also, also my party’s leaders too: reckless statements, saying anything about anyone or any person’s community before the media.
The media will come to you.
It needs its TRPs.
Whenever we are wounded, even the slightest touch of a paper also causes pain.
Thousands of years of injustice have kept these wounds open.
The slightest of damage will cause a lot of pain.
This is why, it does not matter whether the incident is big or small, what matters is that the incident must not happen in the first place.
Which government had more incidents and which didn’t is not the point.
We all have to work collectively to give strength to the country’s unity.
Question: How important is social harmony for economic progress?
PM Modi: Economic progress alone is not the solution.
Peace, unity and harmony is essential for society.
This is true for the society also.
We don’t need unity just to fight poverty alone.
We need to be united and harmonious.
We need to be committed to social justice.
And that is why, unity is not important for economic progress alone.
Peace, unity and harmony are useful in family, life, society and for the nation.
And to all those who believe in Vasudhaive Kutumbakam, the whole world is one.
Question: All political parties talk about removing poverty.
Yet poverty remains an issue of grave concern in our country.
Job creation is a major challenge for you and you have kept this in mind too.
What will be your strategy on both these counts?
PM Modi: You are right.
Poverty alleviation has been a political slogan.
A lot of politics has happened on poverty.
And a lot of programmes for poverty alleviation have also been started keeping elections in mind.
We have to empower the poor to end poverty.
If the poor are empowered, then they have enough power to alleviate poverty.
Politics can be done by keeping the poor poor.
But freedom from poverty can only come by empowerment.
The biggest tool for empowerment is education.
The next point is employment.
Many of them are those who have got money from the bank for the first time.
These people will do something or the other.
It is possible that they might employ a few.
This empowerment will give these people a lot of power.
To educate their children.
They will move forward.
One of the things that we have done is called Stand Up India.
I have told banks that every branch must give financial aid to a Dalit, a tribal and a woman.
They must make them an entrepreneur.
The country has 1.25 Lakh branches of banks.
If they empower even 3 people each, they will benefit 4-5 lakh families.
These are small decisions.
We have big malls in our country.
Lakhs and crores of rupees are spent in constructing them.
There is no time restriction for them.
We have said that these small traders who have small enterprises, they are free to be open 365 days, 24/7..so that they can go about doing their business and also employ a few.
The country has 80 crore youth.
They are below 30 years of age.
If youth have the skill, they can change the fortunes of this country.
And we are laying stress on this.
The country’s youth & employment are at the centre of all economic activity.
In the agriculture sector also, if you move towards value addition, it will create more opportunities to generate employment.
A village youth who has had to go to big towns under pressure, if he is given value addition and agriculture-centric rural development, if we empower him, then employment opportunities shall be created.
Question: You are the first prime minister who has had a direct communication with Indians abroad.
How has this benefitted the country?
PM Modi: Everything should not be measured on a scale of profit and loss.
Because they are away, it pricks them even more.
We have acknowledged the power of the diaspora in Niti Aayog.
This is such a global strength.
They have global exposure.
And I have seen that more than a government’s mission, India’s strength is largely due to the diaspora’s attitude and contacts.
Mission plus diaspora, when they get together, our strength grows manifold.
So this was my role and we are getting good results.
QuestionPM Modi: Firstly, it’s unfortunate that in our country everything we do is immediately linked to elections.
UP elections are still away, still all our decisions are being linked to that.
Super political pundits can’t get politics out of their minds.
Their minds buzzing with politics run faster in AC rooms.
Again, in our country there are frequent elections.
Elections here, elections there…elections, elections, elections.
It’s high time we delinked the two.
Parties will come up with their manifestos after polls are announced.
Why link them now?
Leaders of political parties, when they meet me, emphatically tell me let us please keep elections aside.
There will be decisions and momentum and the bureaucracy will work effectively.
Every party is saying this, but no single party can decide this.
All parties will have to unitedly do this.
Government alone can’t do this.
Election commission has the led this effort and all parties have to agree on this.
I can have my own ideas, but I can’t do anything about it.
This has to be done democratically.
But I do hope some day there will be comprehensive discussion and debate.
There will be elections in five states in coming days and Uttar Pradesh is one of them.
As far as the BJP is concerned, we will fight on development issues only.
Our focus will be welfare of farmers, villages, jobs for the youth, and we will stay committed to the cause of social justice.
Our focus will be to maintain peace, unity and brotherhood in our country.
We will take steps in these regards and move forward.
QuestionPM Modi: The poisons of casteism and communal vote banks have caused enough damage in our country.
The biggest obstacle to strengthening our democracy is vote bank politics.
There was no atmosphere of vote bank politics in last general elections.
There was the atmosphere of development politics.
After 30 years, all sections of our society unitedly voted for a majority government.
An entire section of our society has made a shift.
It’s possible that the people of UP will do a similar thing for betterment of UP.
They will vote keeping development in their mind.
QuestionPM Modi: Whenever we talk about Jammu & Kashmir, we should take the entire picture of Jammu, the Kashmir Valley and the Ladakh region into account.
The seeds of the problem was sown ever since independence and division of our country.
Every government had to battle with this problem.
This is not a new problem.
It is an old one.
I believe the youth of Kashmir will not be distracted.
We will proceed together maintaining peace, unity and goodwill so that the heaven called Kashmir will remain a heaven.
Problems will also get solved.
That’s why I always maintain that people of Kashmir need both development and trust.
And 1 billion Indians has always stayed committed to both development and it has never wavered from its commitment of trust.
This belief is still there today and it will always be there in future as well.
Question: It’s widely believed that high level corruption has come down drastically under your rule, but low level corruption is still rampant.
How can you fix this?
PM Modi: I’m grateful to you that you have accepted that there is no high-level corruption.
If the Ganga is clean at Gaumukh, it will gradually become pure while flowing down.
You may have noticed that we have taken many steps which have neutralised chances of any corruption.
For instance we have shifted the gas subsidy system into the Direct Benefit Scheme.
Ghost clients who used to wrongly enjoy the benefits of gas subsidy are no longer there.
Chandigarh was being supplied 30 lakh litres of kerosene.
Using technology we stopped providing kerosene to those houses which have gas connection and electricity.
And we provided gas connections to those who earlier didn’t have.
That’s how we made Chandigarh kerosene free and saved 30 lakh litres of kerosene from being sold in the black market.
The other day Haryana’s chief minister was telling me he is going to make eight districts kerosene free by this November.
You would know our farmers used to be desperate for urea and used to buy from black market.
Black marketeers ruled.
In some states farmers buying urea from the black market were even lathicharged.
You must have noticed there is no news of urea shortfall these days.
Chemical factories used to process this as raw material and brought out finished products.
They used to get urea cheap.
Chemical factories and middlemen enjoyed the cream.
We started neem coating of urea.
Additionally, we raised production of urea by 20 lakh tonnes.
We are also neem coating imported urea.
Not only that, tribals in Gujarat who were engaged to collect neem seeds for this purpose have started extracting neem oil while neem coating, and have earned up to 10 to 12 crore rupees .
This is a win-win situation.
Corruption and difficulties both gone.
Likewise, we can do away with low level corruption through policy decisions and using technology.
You will start liking at low level what you liked at top level.
Question: Mr Prime Minister, it’s being said that Lutyens Delhi did not like you, but have you started liking Delhi?
PM Modi: As you know the position of prime minister is such that there’s no question of liking or disliking Lutyens Delhi.
But there’s is a need to deliberate on this.
In Delhi’s power corridors, there’s an active group of people which is dedicated to only a few.
It could be because of their own reasons or personal gains.
Look at what happened to Morarji Desai.
This same group never talked about his abilities, achievements.
And what happened with the supremely talented Ambedkar who they are praising today.
They made fun of him.
So I’m not surprised when they make fun of him.
These custodians who are dedicated to a select few will never accept anyone who is linked to the roots of this country.
It’s better if I live with the poor people of this country who are like me.
Question: It’s often said in media circles that if TRP rating are down cut to Modi rallies.
Still you have a bitter-sweet relationship with media.
What do you have to say about the media?
PM Modi: Media has played a major contribution to whatever I’m today.
Yes, I don’t give soundbytes here and there.
Media may complain that Modiji doesn’t make spicy, controversial remarks.
This is a genuine complaint.
I’m mostly involved in my work and my work speaks.
Media is doing its job and it should.
I believe the media must strongly criticise the government’s work.
Otherwise democracy won’t work.
But unfortunately, in this TRP rat-race, the media doesn’t have enough time for research.
Criticism is not possible without research.
For 10 minutes of criticism you need 10 hours of research.
Instead of criticism, it gets into levelling allegations.
As a result democracy gets weakened.
Governments must be afraid of media criticisms, but that’s fast going away.
I want media to be very critical based on facts.
The country will benefit from this.
So I’m glad that at least I’m useful to them this way.
More than my rallies, to win TRP they get people to abuse me.
Question: Like the media you seem to have a strained relationship with the judiciary.
PM Modi: This is a totally wrong perception.
This government goes by rules, the law and the constitution.
There is no scope for any confrontation or tension with any constitutional institution.
There must be as much warmth with judiciary as needed for constitutional decorum.
I try my best to maintain as much decorum as possible.
Question: I would like to ask you few some personal questions.
You have this image of a strong leader, but on a few occasions your emotional side came out.
People would like to know what kind of human being you are.
PM Modi: A soldier who bravely fights on the border and the same soldier when he plays with his daughter cannot behave in the same manner.
Narendra Modi, whatever he is, is after all a human being.
Why should I suppress or hide what’s inside me?
Let people see what they see.
As far as my duties and responsibilities are concerned, I have to fulfill them to the best of my abilities.
If I have to take strong decisions for the country’s sake, then I will have to make those decisions.
If I have to work hard for that then I will have to.
But these are nor facets of my character, these are part of my responsibilities.
There is nothing like real or fake Modi.
If you take off your political glasses, then you will see the real Modi.
But you will do a mistake if you continue to judge Modi through your perceived notions.
Question: Modiji, I have met you many times in Gandhinagar when you were CM and even in the PMO.
I have never seen any file, paper or even phone on your table.
No one ever intervened during our meetings.
You function like a CEO.
Some say you hear more and speak less.
What’s your working style?
PM Modi: You have made right observations.
I have been painted as one who doesn’t listen and only talks down.
I actually hear a lot and observe a lot.
That’s how I have evolved as a person.
I have benefitted a lot through this.
I’m a workaholic, but basically I always like to live in the present.
If you have come to meet me then I get immersed in that meeting.
I don’t touch the phone or see the paper and I don’t lose focus.
When I see files I similarly get immersed and get lost in those files.
I live every moment in the present.
The person who meets me is always satisfied that I have given him quality time.
One must always learn and understand.
One must have the courage to leave those ideas that were relevant in the past years back but are no longer now.
One must have the courage to change oneself.
This is how I developed my style of functioning.
Question: You have punishing schedule of 16 to 18 hours.
So how do you relax?
PM Modi: I relax through working only.
I never get tired of working.
In fact the opposite tires me.
That satisfaction gives you energy.
I have felt this and always tell this to my young friends.
Tiredness is more psychological.
Everyone has the same capacity needed for the volume of the work.
PM Modi: My village belonged to the Gaekwad estate and as a child I gained a lot from that environment.
The specialty of Gaekwad king was that he used to build libraries and primary schools in every village.
I studied in that school.
I developed an interest in reading books.
Now there’s not much time to read.
Those books made an impact.
From 12 years of age I started taking part in oratory competitions.
I used to like Vivekananda quotations and his style of delivery a lot.
Modi is just one of those 1.25 billion Indians, nothing more.
Modi’s identity must get lost among those 1.25 billion people.
There will be no greater joy for me than Modi getting lost in the pages of history.
Modiji thank you so much for giving me your time.
This is my first TV interview and I feel privileged and honoured to done with no less a person than the Prime Minister.
I congratulate you and keep doing the good work.
You please keep giving us interviews…
PM Modi: Why interview politicians only, there are so many others from other walks of life to interview.
During election time, reporters start shooting from your bedroom and start asking about breakfast etc.
But not many know the sacrifices of our sportsmen.
Our youth must be shown those sacrifices.
I would like your channel to choose 30 sportsmen from the Rio contigent and show their life story.
That way we can change the way we see our sportsmen.

Your Excellency President Xi Jinping, my esteemed BRICS Colleagues, Distinguished Leaders
I am delighted to be here with you all today.
I thank President Xi Jinping for bringing us together for this dialogue.
The bedrock of our development agenda lies in the notion of “SabkaSaath,SabkaVikaas” – that is: Collective Effort, Inclusive Growth.
We have mapped each of the SDGs to our own development programmes and scheme, both at the federal and state level.
Our Parliament too has taken the initiative to organize Parliamentary debates on SDGs.
Our programmes are geared to accomplish these priority goals in a time-bound manner.
To cite just one example, our three-pronged approach of providing a bank account to the unbanked, providing a biometric identity to all, and using innovative mobile governance solutions, has enabled Direct Benefit Transfers to almost 360 million people for the first time.
We would like to see such domestic efforts buttressed by strong international partnerships.
And, for this, we stand ready to do our part.
India has a long tradition of partnerships with fellow developing countries, while pursuing our own aspirations for growth.
At every step, we have shared our experience and resources across a range of sectors: from strengthening democratic institutions to deploying high-tech solutions for public good.
Earlier this year, we launched the South Asia Satellite to benefit willing regional partners in meeting their developmental goals in education, healthcare, communication, and disaster management.
For over half a century, India’s flagship initiative – Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation, ITEC – has offered training and skill development to 161 partner countries from Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Caribbean and Pacific Island states.
From Africa alone, over the last decade, over 25,000 students have trained in India on ITEC scholarships.
The countries present here together represent almost half of the humanity.
Whatever we do, will impact the world substantially.
I am very fortunate that once again I have got the opportunity to meet you.
His highness crown prince of Abu Dhabhi visited India in 2016.
In 2017, he was the Chief Guest of our extremely important Republic Day function.
I express my heartfelt gratitude to the gulf countries, I salute them.
They have provided this kind of good environment to more than 30 lakh Indians as if it is their second home outside India.
Indian community also sowed the seeds of their dreams along with the dreams of local people and also with the same commitment by considering this place as their own home.
And because of this thing it will also become a medium for acquiring an unique Indian identity.
I have this expectation from all of you.
Today, the country is scaling new heights of development.
It’s a matter of pride for India that today the country has been given a place of particular respect in a global level summit.
I have been invited to address the summit.
Here, it’s not difficult for you to gather information about India.
You have such knowledge about India that if I talk about one thing then you will talk about ten things.
And in a way a mini India resides here.
There is not even a single corner in this country where India is not represented.
And that is why you can experience very well how fast India has been changing and with what kind of confidence 1.25 billion Indians have been moving ahead to realise their dreams.
We have also witnessed those days of despair when it was like: friends, let’s leave it, nothing is going to happen.
Friends, let’s pack your belongings and go somewhere else.
We have been through those periods of despair, apprehension and confusion.
We will have to work hard keeping in view our long term interests.
Mahatma Gandhi used to talk about Shreya (what must be done) and Priya (what is liked by us).
It should be our effort that we should move ahead by taking steps in the direction of those objectives that must be fulfilled.
We may or may not like them now but these things will be in our long term interests.
For others it is a problem and they take time to understand.
If I replace currency then the poor section of the society immediately understands that it’s a solid step in the right direction.
However, the one who spent sleepless nights continues to weep even after two years.
For the last seven years it was being debated whether GST law should be implemented or not.
It’s been done now.
However, when we wake up the next morning we go the left side habitually believing that the bathroom was there and we hit the wall.
Then there will be difficulties when things have to be changed.
However, it’s worthwhile to do so.

The High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka,
Hon’ble Chief Minister of the Northern Province,
Hon’ble Members of Parliament of Sri Lanka
Respected Religious leaders,
Distinguished guests,
I am very happy to be talking to you in Jaffna today through Live Video Link.
I am all the more happy that this is the occasion when the National Emergency Ambulance service is being extended all over Sri Lanka.
This event marks another major achievement in the development partnership of India and Sri Lanka.
I am very happy that in July 2016, the first phase of this service began in the Western and Southern Provinces.
During my visit to Sri Lanka last year I had promised the friendly people of Sri Lanka that India will work for expanding the pre-hospital Emergency Ambulance Service all over Sri Lanka.
I am happy that India has completed its promise in a timely manner and we have marked today the beginning of the second phase of the Service.
I am also happy that this phase of expansion begins with the Northern Province.
India is happy to work together with you for wipingtears from the past and ushering in a bright future.
I understand that the people associated with this service have been trained in India.
The requiredskills and the local employment will also receive a boost.
It is not just a co-incidence that India has the privilegeto be Sri Lanka’s partner in establishing this first responder service and in its expansion.
In good times and bad, India has been, and will always be the first responder for Sri Lanka.
As leaders of two democracies full of diversity, both Prime Minister Wickeremesinghe and I believe in delivering benefits of development to all sections of the society.
I appreciate the efforts of President His Excellency Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickeremesinghe for meeting the aspirations of all the citizens of Sri Lanka.
I have very fond memories from my two visits to Sri Lanka as Prime Minister.
I have been overwhelmed by the love and affection, which were showered on me.
I also had the good fortune of being the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Jaffna.
I could also participate last year in the UN Vesak day celebrations.
All these are unforgettable experiences.
The existence of all nations is closely linked to their neighbours.
When I look at Sri Lanka, I see not only a neighbour, I see a very special and trusted partner of India in South Asia and in the Indian Ocean family.
I believe that our development cooperation with Sri Lanka is an important means for translating our vision of shared progress into reality.
I am reminded of what Mahatma Gandhi had said in 1927, when he had visited Sri Lanka at the invitation of the student Congress of Jaffna.
He had then travelled from Matara in the South to Point Pedro in the North.
I would encourage you to come to India and experience the New India that is taking shape.
I am happy to learn that His Excellency Prime MinisterWickeremesinghewill be visiting India in early August.
I wish you a comfortable journey and enjoyable stay in India..
Thank you very much.
The amalgamation will help create a strong globally competitive bank with economies of scale and enable realisation of wide-ranging synergies.

Mrs. Florence Parly, the French Minister for the Armed Forces, called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi today.
 
 
 
Congratulations Vikas Thakur for the Bronze in the men’s 94kg event.
I am happy to be here today on the occasion of the golden jubilee week of Auroville.
 
It is important today to remember the vast extent of action and thought of Shri Aurobindo.
 
Rabindranath, O Aurobindo, bows to thee!
 
Many of the world’s great religions were born here.
 
Recently, the United Nations has declared June 21 as International Day of Yoga, recognizing a great Indian tradition.
Auroville has brought together men and women, young and old, cutting across boundaries and identities.
 
 
The first high principle of Auroville is that it belongs to all humanity.
 
I learn that today, it has over two thousand, four hundred residents from forty-nine countries.
 
 
 
Auroville was conceived with the vision of enveloping the whole of humanity in one small area.
This would show that the future would see an integrated world.
 
As the world progresses materially through science and technology, it will increasingly long for and need spiritual orientation for social order and stability.
 
The fifth basic principle of Auroville is that it will be a place of un-ending learning and constant progress, so that it never stagnates.
The progress of humanity calls for continuous thinking and re-thinking, so that the human mind does not become frozen into one idea.
The very fact that Auroville has brought together such huge diversity of people and ideas makes dialogue and debate natural.
Auroville show-cases this ancient Indian tradition to the world by bringing together global diversity.
 
 
In ancient times, our sages and ‘Rishis’ would perform ‘yagya’ to begin great endeavours.
 
The world has received positive vibrations from Auroville, in many forms, over the years.
 
On the occasion of 50 years of Auroville, I hope you can enhance your efforts in this direction.
Serving young minds through education will be a big tribute to Sri Aurobindo and the Mother.
 
Shri Kireet Bhai Joshi, an ardent disciple of Sri Aurobindo, and the Mother, was an eminent educationist.
 
May Auroville continue to come up with ideas to empower the ordinary citizens of this country.
 
May it be the guardian which calls for breaking down narrow walls of the mind.

You have brought peace and stability to your nation and to the region.
You have put it on the path of growth and progress amidst many challenges.
You have empowered women and made your nation more inclusive.
Your visionary leadership has enabled Ugandan people of Indian origin to return to their cherished home, regain their lives and help rebuild the nation that they deeply love.
In opening the State House to the celebration of Deepawali, you have lit up the many strands of ties that connect India and Uganda.
Among these, the most sacred is the site at Jinja, at the source of River Nile, where a portion of the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi were immersed.
In his life and beyond, he is one with Africa and Africans.
And, at the sacred site in Jinja, where a statue of Gandhiji now stands, we will build a Gandhi Heritage Centre.
As we approach the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, there can be no better homage than a Centre to remind us of Africa’s role in shaping his mission that even inspired Africa to freedom and justice; and the universal and timeless values of his life and message.
India pursued Afro-Asian solidarity in Bandung.
Our economic and international partnerships over the past seven decades have been prompted as much by economic impulse as by the moral principles and emotional bonds.
We sought a fair and equitable access to markets and resources.
Our doctors and teachers went to Africa not just to seek professional opportunities, but in solidarity with a common cause of development as free nations.
India is proud to be Africa’s partner.
The first, of 141 million US dollars for electricity lines.
And the second, of 64 million US dollars for agriculture and dairy production.
As in the past, we will continue to support the aspirations of the people of Uganda – in agriculture and healthcare, education and training, infrastructure and energy, capacity building in government and training in defence.
I compliment President Museveni and this House on the decision to join the International Solar Alliance.
As with Uganda, we have deepened our partnership and engagement across the vast expanse of Africa.
In the past four years, our President, Vice President and I have collectively visited no less than 25 countries in Africa.
Our Ministers have covered virtually all African nations.
We were honoured to host all 54 countries – over 40 at Heads of State and Government level – at the third Africa-India Forum Summit in October 2015.
We were also privileged to host many African leaders for the inaugural summit of the International Solar Alliance.
Other than all these, 32 Heads of State or Government from Africa have visited India in the last four years.
Our development partnership currently includes implementation of 180 Lines of Credit worth about USD 11 billion in over 40 African countries.
At the last India Africa Forum Summit, we had committed a concessional Line of Credit of 10 billion U.S. dollars and 600 million dollars in grant assistance.
Indian companies have invested over US$ 54 billion in Africa.
 
With several coastal nations, our partnership now increasingly seeks to harness the benefits of Blue Economy in a sustainable manner.
 
 
 
Indian women established a landmark with the first all-female Police Unit of the United Nations in Liberia.
Our defence and security cooperation is growing with nations in Africa, as we work together to counter terrorism and piracy, and keep our seas secure.
India will work with you and for you.
Our partnership will build instruments of empowerment in Africa.
We will stand in solidarity with your endeavours, in transparency, with respect and on the principle of equality.
And, let us be guided by the Ugandan saying that is – “Anayejitahidi hufaidi” which means “one who makes the extra effort will benefit”.
India has made that extra effort for Africa.

My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
This journey has reached its 50th episode today.
Thus, this Golden Jubilee Episode is indeed gilt-edged in every sense of the term.
Your letters and phone calls this time pertain mostly to these 50 episodes.
Anshu Kumar & Amar Kumar from Delhi on Mygov, Vikas Yadav from Patna; on similar lines Monica Jain from Delhi, Prosenjit Sarkar from Bardhaman, West Bengal and Sangeeta Shastri from Nagpur converge in asking a shared question.
It was the month of May; and I was travelling to a certain place.
He was not even adequately clad; it was a standalone kiosk on the edge of the road.
And he replied, “India has exploded the bomb today!”
I exclaimed, “India has exploded the bomb!
Said he “Sir, just listen to the radio”.
Indeed, that exactly was the topic of discussion on the radio.
Hence when I became the Prime Minister, it was natural for me to turn towards a strong, effective medium.
And in 2014, when I took charge as the Pradhan Sevak, Principal Servant, it was my wish to reach out to the masses with the glorious saga of our country’s unity, her grand history, her valour, India’s diversity, our cultural diversity, virtues embedded in our society such as Purusharth, Tapasya, Passion & sacrifice; in a nutshell, the great story of India.
Recently, All India Radio got a survey done on ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
I came across some feedback that is very interesting.
Out of the designated sample in the survey, 70% of respondents on an average happen to be listeners who regularly tune in to ‘’Mann Ki Baat’.
Most people believe that the greatest contribution of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has been the enhancement of a feeling of positivity in our society.
The medium of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ has promoted many a mass revolution. #indiapositive has been the subject of quite an extensive discussion.
This is an exemplary glimpse of the feeling of positivity, innate to our countrymen.
People have shared their experiences, conveying the rise of selfless volunteerism as a consequence of ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
It is a change where people are increasingly willing to contribute for the sake of service to society.
I am overjoyed on account of the fact that through ‘Mann Ki Baat’, radio is rising as a popular medium, more than ever before.
I express my gratitude to the entire family of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ for being a part of it & trusting it wholeheartedly.
Thank you very much for your phone call.
Your apprehension is not misplaced.
The fact is, if a leader gets hold of a microphone with assured listeners to the tune of millions, what else does he need?
Significantly, some young friends have attempted a study on the myriad subjects touched upon, over the many episodes of ‘Mann Ki Baat’.
This new inspiration & zest will keep taking her to greater heights.
At times, when I look back, I am taken aback.
Sometimes people who write in from different corners of the country say, “We should not haggle beyond limits with marginal shopkeepers, auto drivers, vegetable sellers et al”.
I read a letter & then try to weave it with the essence of a similar letter.
At times Mann Ki Baat is also sneered at but 130 crore countrymen ever occupy a special pleace in my heart.
Manythanks for your phone call.
In a way your question were the a personal,amiable touch.
Actually, Mann Ki Baat is a very simpletask for me.
My countrymen stay in my heart every moment and that is how the writer’s situation and ideas expressed in the letter become part of my thought process.
I congratulate and thank those persons for their talent and skills.
I would request all of you also to kindly listen to this programme in your regional language as well.
I sincerely thank from the core of my heart my friends in the media who regularly telecast Mann Ki Baat on their channels.
I try to share the efforts and achievements of the youth as much as possible through “Mann Ki Baat”.
There is a general complaint that the younger generation asks too many questions.
I say it is good that the youth ask questions.
It is good as it shows that they want to analyse everything from its very root.
We feel that the youths are very ambitious today and they plan big.
Some people say that the younger generation wants to accomplish a many things at a time.
I say what is wrong in it.
They do so because they are adept in multitasking.
If we just look around, we find that it is the youth who are bringing in transformation of society in a big way, may it be social entrepreneurship, start-ups, sports or any other field.
Those youth who have dared to ask questions and have had the courage to dream big.
My dear countrymen, Vineeta ji from Gurugram- has posted on MyGov that in Mann Ki Baat I should talk about the “Constitution Day” which falls on the26th November.
She says that this day is special because we are going to enter into the 70th year of our Constitution adoption.
Thank you very much for your suggestion Vineeta ji.
Yes, tomorrow is the Constitution Day.
The Constituent Assembly took 2 years 11 months and 17 days to accomplish this stupendous task of drafting the Constitution.
Just imagine, these luminaries gave us such a comprehensive and detailed Constitution within a period of just less than 3 years.
The extraordinary pace at which they drafted the Constitution is an example of Time Management and productivity to emulate even today.
This also inspires us to accomplish our responsibilities within a record time.
A balance between these two in the lives of our citizens will take our nation forward.
If we respect the rights of others, our rights will automatically get protected and similarly if we fulfill our duties, then also our rights will get automatically protected.
I still remember that in 2010 when 60 years of the adoption of the Constitution were being celebrated, we had taken out a procession by placing our Constitution atop an elephant.
This has been a memorable incident to increase awareness about our Constitution among the youth and to connect them to the various aspects of the Constitution.
In the year 2020, we shall complete 70 years as a Republic and in 2022, we shall enter 75th year of our Independence.
Let us all take forward the values enshrined in our Constitution and ensure Peace, Progress and Prosperity in our country.
My dear countrymen, while talking about the Constituent Assembly, the contribution of that great man cannot be forgotten who played a pivotal role in the Constituent Assembly.
He had made a very moving appeal in the Constituent Assembly that we have to safeguard our hard fought democracy till the last drop of our blood.
Once again my humble tribute to revered Baba Saheb.
My dear countrymen, two days back on 23rd November, we all celebrated Shri Guru Nanak Dev Jayanti and next year in 2019 we shall be celebrating his 550th Prakash Parv.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji always envisaged the welfare of entire humanity.
He always showed the path of truth, work, service, kindness and amity to the society.
All states and Union Territories have been requested to celebrate the occasion in a grand manner.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s 550th Prakash Parv will be celebrated in a similar manner in all the countries of the world as well.
Besides, a train will be run on a route joining all the holy places connected with Guru Nanak Dev ji.
Recently, while holding a meeting in this regard I remembered about of Lakhpat Saheb Gurudwara.
The Government of India has taken a significant decision of building Kartarpur corridor so that our countrymen could easily visit Kartarpur in Pakistan to pay homage to Guru Nanak Dev Ji at that holy sight.
The more you connect with us, our journey will gain greater depth, providing, satisfaction to one and all.
At times a question arises in the minds of people’s as to what I achieved through Mann Ki Baat.
 
 
Come on, let us take this journey further.

I believe that Mahatma Gandhi is still as relevant in today’s world as he was in his lifetime: Shri Narendra Modi
Ever since he tookover as the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi ensured that Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals, principles and teachings are held aloft, both in India and abroad, through his speeches and actions.
The National Salt Satyagraha Memorial, dedicated to the nation by the Prime Minister on January 30, 2019, recreates the spirit and the energy of one of the defining moments of India’s freedom struggle.
It is a depiction of the Dandi March by the Mahatma, and 80 of his fellow Satyagrahis – the occasion when a pinch of salt rocked the colonial rule.
The Salt Satyagraha Memorial is just one of many initiatives taken by the Prime Minister, which carry forward the legacy of the Mahatma.
While launching this scheme, he had said “A clean India would be the best tribute India could pay to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary in 2019”.
Thanks to Shri Narendra Modi, Swachhta has become a mass movement, reminiscent indeed of the days of Mahatma Gandhi, when the quest for freedom had become a mass movement.
States have competed vigorously in the race to become Open Defecation Free, and India is now close to achieving 100 percent rural sanitation coverage.
Khadi was a subject that Mahatma Gandhi brought to the core of India’s consciousness during the freedom struggle.
Shri Narendra Modi used his monthly ‘Mann Ki Baat’ programme, to encourage people to buy Khadi products and thereby emphasizing on the revival of Khadi and cottage industries.
Shri Narendra Modi’s call had such an impact that the sale of Khadi products showed a quantum jump.
Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th anniversaryis being celebrated as a two year event, with many programmes outlined to celebrate the occasion.
Mahatma Gandhi’s favourite hymn ‘Vaishnav Jan To’, went global, with artists from over 124 countries contributing musically to it.
The project created a global appeal to a beautiful Indian bhajan.

He said that 11 crore people have so far benefited from the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
He said that one of the aims of this scheme is also to increase self-confidence among the people.
Let me begin by sincerely thanking President Xi again for his warm reception and the excellent organisation of this Summit.
Our interaction during the restricted session was constructive.
It enriched our mutual understanding and perspectives.
After more than a decade of existence, BRICS has developed a robust framework for cooperation.
We contribute stability and growth in a world drifting towards uncertainty.
While trade and economy have been the foundation of our cooperation, our endeavours today touch diverse areas of technology, tradition, culture, agriculture, environment, energy, sports, and ICT.
The New Development Bank has started disbursing loans in pursuit of its mandate to mobilize resources for infrastructure and sustainable development in BRICS countries.
At the same time, our Central Banks have taken steps to make the Contingent Reserve Arrangement fully operational.
These are milestones of progress we can build upon.
Looking ahead, it is important that our people remain at the centre of our journey.
I am happy to note that China has taken forward the people-to-people thrust of our exchanges from last year.
Such inter-mingling will consolidate our links and deepen our understanding.
India’s own far-reaching journey of transformation gives pride of place to our people.
We are in mission-mode to eradicate poverty; to ensure health, sanitation, skills, food security, gender equality, energy, education and innovation.
National programmes of Clean Ganga, Renewable Energy, Digital India, Smart Cities, Housing for All and Skill India are laying the basis for clean, green and inclusive development.
They are also tapping the creative energy of our 800 million youth.
Our women’s empowerment programmes are productivity multipliers that mainstream women in nation building.
We have also stepped up the fight against black money and corruption.
Moving forward, using the springboard of our national experiences, BRICS countries can deepen partnership for win-win results.
Some thoughts come to mind for upgrading mutual cooperation.
First, last year we discussed pooling our efforts to create a BRICS rating agency.
An Expert Group has since been studying the viability of such an agency.
I would urge that the roadmap for its creation should be finalized at the earliest.
Second, our Central Banks must further strengthen their capabilities and promote co-operation between the Contingent Reserve Arrangement and the IMF.
Third, affordable, reliable, and sustainable access to energy is crucial for the development of our nations.
Climate resilient development calls upon us to utilise all available resource streams.
Renewable energy is particularly important on multiple counts.
It will bring together a coalition of 121 countries for mutual gains through enhanced solar energy utilisation.
BRICS countries can work closely with ISA to strengthen the solar energy agenda.
Our five countries have complementary skills and strengths to promote use of renewable and solar energy.
The NDB can also establish an effective link with ISA to support such cooperation.
We would wish to see more clean energy funding, particularly in solar energy, from the NDB.
Fourth, we are nations with large youth populations.
We need to mainstream our youth in our joint initiatives as far as possible.
Scaled up cooperation in skill development and exchange of best practices will be a valuable instrument.
Fifth, at the Goa Summit last year we had exchanged thoughts on smart-cities, urbanization, and disaster-management in the context of cooperation between our cities.
We need to further accelerate this track.
Sixth, Technology and innovation are the foundations of the next generation of global growth and transformation.
India has also found that technology and digital resources are powerful tools in fighting poverty and corruption.
A strong BRICS partnership on innovation and digital economy can help spur growth, promote transparency and support the Sustainable Development Goals.
I would suggest considering a collaborative pilot project under the BRICS framework, including private entrepreneurship.
Now, the next decade is crucial.
If we as BRICS can set the agenda in these areas, the world will call this its Golden Decade.
In our outreach segment with emerging markets tomorrow.
I will share some of our ideas in this regard.
The focus of the budget is on issues ranging from agriculture to Infrastructure.
On the one hand, the budget covers aspects such as health plans to address the concerns of the poor and middle class, while on the other hand it has plans to increase the wealth of small entrepreneurs in the country.
Other aspects range from food processing to fiber optics, from road to shipping, concerns of youth to those of senior citizens, rural India to Ayushman India and Digital India to Start up India.
It is farmer friendly, common man friendly, business environment friendly as well as development friendly.
Ease of Doing Business as well as Ease of Living are in focus in this budget.
More savings for the middle class, new generation infrastructure for 21st Century India and assurance of better health – all these are concrete steps towards Ease of Living.
We are also familiar with the cluster based approach for the development of the industry in our country.
Now, keeping in mind the agricultural produce in different districts, agricultural cluster approach will be adopted in different districts across the country.
I welcome the plan to develop storage, processing and marketing facilities for a particular agricultural produce after identifying the relevant districts.
In our country, the cooperative societies are exempted from paying income tax.
But the ‘Farmer Producer Organization’ -FPO, that is similar to the cooperative societies, does not get this benefit.
Therefore, income tax exemption for the ‘Farmer Producer Organization’ -FPO, which is meant for the welfare of the farmers, is a welcome step.
By providing the linkages between the Self Help Groups for women engaged in organic, aromatic and herbal cultivation and the ‘Farmer Producer Organizations’ the income of the farmers will be increased.
Similarly, the Gobar-Dhan Yojana will help in keeping the village clean, while increasing the income of farmers and cattle herders.
In our country farmers take up different occupations along with the farming.
Some are associated with pisciculture, animal husbandry, poultry or bee-keeping.
Farmers used to face difficulties in accessing loans from banks for such additional activities.
But now with Kisan card Arranging loan for pisciculture and animal husbandry has become very effective.
There are about 7000 blocks in more than 700 districts of India.
In these blocks, emphasis has been laid on modernization of infrastructure of 22 thousand rural business centers, by innovative and increased connectivity in the villages.
In the days to come, these centers will be able to enhance the income of farmers, create employment opportunities.
This will bring about new hubs of agro based rural and agricultural economy.
Under Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojna, now the villages will be connected to rural haats (markets), higher education centers and hospitals.
It will make life easier for the people in these villages.
We have seen an extension of the spirit of the Ease of Living in Ujjwala Yojana.
The scheme has not only provided relief to the poor women from the smoke but has also become a huge source of their empowerment.
I am happy to note that the target for Ujjawala has been enhanced from 5 crore families to 6 crore families.
A large number of dalit, tribal and backward class families have been benefited from this scheme.
This budget provides for allocation of about Rs 1 lakh crore for the welfare of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.
Medical treatment and its cost has always been a cause of concern for the lower middle class and poor sections of the society.
The new scheme ‘Ayushman Bharat’, presented in the budget, will address this serious concern.

This is by far, the world’s largest health insurance plan for which government will bear the cost.
The idea of setting up 1.5lakh Health Wellness Centers spread over all the major panchayats of the country is commendable.
This will provide easy access to health care services to the people living in the villages.
Establishment of 24 new medical colleges across the country will not only facilitate the treatment of the people but also help to impart medical education to the youngsters.
It is our endeavor to have at least one medical college for covering three parliamentary constituencies across the country.
Several important decisions have been taken in this budget keeping in mind the concerns 0f Senior Citizens.
Now Senior Citizens will be entitled to have a minimum interest of 8% on amount up to Rs 15 lakh under the Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandan Yojana.
No tax will be levied on interest up to Rs 50,000 on their Bank and Post Office deposits.
For a long time, the small and medium enterprises or the MSME in our country had to pay higher taxes than the big industries.
A bold step has been taken in this budget wherein the government has reduced the tax rate for MSME by 5%.
They will now have to pay only 25% tax in place of 30% which was the practice earlier.
Credit seeking facility from the banks and NBFCs has been eased to ensure the required working capital for MSME industries.
It will give a further impetus to the mission of Make in India.
MSME sector has been experiencing stress due to NPA in big industries.
The small entrepreneurs must not suffer because of the fault of others.
Therefore, the government will soon announce corrective measures to resolve the problems related to NPA and Stressed Account in the MSME sector.
In order to promote employment and to provide social security to employees the government has taken a far reaching decision.
This will give a push to shift from informal to formal sector and will generate new job opportunities.
Now the government will contribute 12% in EPF Account of new laborers for a period of 3 years.
These schemes will enhance employment opportunities in our country manifold.
I congratulate the Finance Minister for tax concession to the salaried and middle class.
This budget will live up to the expectation of every Indian Citizen.
The budget has ensured the following – remunerative price of crop to the farmer, upliftment of the poor with welfare schemes, respecting honesty of tax paying citizen, support to the spirit of entrepreneurs with a right tax structure and hailing the contribution of senior citizens to the country.

Ladies and Gentlemen,
A very warm welcome to all the delegates from across the world to the Partners’ Forum, 2018.
Countries have moved beyond stand-alone efforts.
A lot yet remains to be done.
From bigger budgets to better out-comes, and from mind-set change to monitoring, there is lots to be done.
Hope that behavioural change can be ensured.
Hope that rapid progress can be achieved.
I am pleased to note that Latin America and Caribbean region and India will be show-casing adaptations of the global strategy during the course of this Forum.
I hope that these adaptations will inspire other countries and regions to develop similar strategies.
I firmly believe that a nation prospers when its people and importantly the women, and childrenare educated; and are able to live independent, empowered and healthy lives.
When my government assumed office in 2014, we were losing more than 44,000 mothers, annually, during child-birth.
Children’s nutrition is being addressed through the POSHAN Abhiyan.
This has provided 800 million health screening check-ups, and free referral treatment to 20 million children, in the last four years.
One thing that constantly worried us was the high out-of-pocket expenditure incurred by families to avail medical care.
We therefore launched the Ayushman Bharat Yojana.
Ayushman Bharat has a two-fold strategy.
The other arm of Ayushman Bharat is the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.
This number is almost equal to the population of Canada, Mexico and the US taken together.
We have already provided free treatment worth 700 Crore rupees to 5 lakh families under this scheme within 10 weeks of its launch.
I instructed my officials to identify 117 ‘Aspirational Districts’.
Each such district has been entrusted to a team that works across sectors like education, water and sanitation, rural development with top-most priority to health and nutrition.
This scheme enables direct benefit transfer to their bank accounts to compensate for wage loss, enable better nutrition and adequate rest before and after delivery.
I would like to stress on the need for multi-stake-holder partnerships for achieving success.
In all our endeavours, we are aware that effective healthcare, especially for womenand children, is best organized through convergent action.
I call upon each one of you here, including those who have joined us virtually, to embrace this in true spirit, so that we are able to extend our support to the entire humanity.

Prime Minister welcomed Deputy Prime Minister Rogozin to India on his third visit this year.
He noted with satisfaction the marked increase in high-level exchanges this year and warmly recalled his own visit to St. Petersburg in June for the Annual Bilateral Summit.
It is not every day that one meets a prime minister representing 1.2 billion people, one considered a superstar at home and abroad.
Maybe that is why the meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi felt so special.
Modi is set to arrive in Israel on July 4 for what will be a historic visit: the first to this country by a sitting Indian prime minister.
Despite the disparity in the sizes of the two countries, the relationship between them is one of equals, as far as he is concerned.
Modi is a different kind of leader.
With sky-high popularity among Indians, he can say what he wants and push for the reforms he seeks.
He has tried to move India forward and make it a global leader.
For him, the path to achieving those goals passes through Israel.
This should be a badge of honor for all Israelis.
He knows Indians love him, but he also knows that he must not fail.
That is his big challenge.
When I arrive at Modi’s official residence, I discover that the man who always looks tough in front of the cameras is a friendly person who knows how to smile.
He takes immense pride in his success in pulling himself up by the bootstraps after being born into poverty.
Exuding confidence, Modi shares with me a local dictum he uses as his mantra: “Sarvajan Hitay Sarvajan Sukhay, Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.”
He believes the two nations are soulmates.
They share a spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation that gives the partnership its own dimension.
He and his people have also gone out of their way to tap into this sentiment by organizing a rally for the local Indian community in Tel Aviv on July 5, to be led by Modi himself.
In India, Israel is perceived as a technological powerhouse, and a country that has braved many odds.
Many tech-based inventions have their roots in Israeli universities and laboratories and have benefited humankind.
These include articles ranging from USB flash drives to cherry tomatoes.
The way you transformed yourself from being a water-deficient country to a water-surplus country; the manner in which you made your deserts bloom, are all amazing accomplishments.
All these images have made a deep imprint on my mind.”
In fact, over the years, they have been continuously expanding and diversifying.
It is in line with our view that our ties should be reflected in all spheres of our engagement and backed by regular high-level contact.
I think that this year, as we celebrate 25 years of our diplomatic relations, it is an opportune occasion to take the relationship to a new level.”
We remain engaged with all our partners, including Israel, in finding optimal outcomes at the U.N. and other multilateral fora that reflect our commonly shared priorities and concerns.
India is not in favor of singling out any country at the U.N.”
We want to engage constructively with both the East and the West.
We are in full agreement that elements which perpetrate violence on innocent people should not be allowed to flourish.
Cross-border terrorism is a major challenge for us.
Divisive forces across our border are trying to disrupt the unity of our nation.
These troublemakers often misuse religion as a tool to misguide youth in our country and our regions.
Terrorism should not be equated with any particular religion.
India and Israel could cooperate even more closely and complement each other’s efforts to fight with the menace of terrorism.”
I am confident that my visit will lead to further strengthening of our relations in different areas and also open up new priorities for cooperation.”
I am sure I will visit Jerusalem.
Elements of my visit and its program is being so arranged so that we can focus to taking forward our partnership with Israel in all the spheres, including technology and innovation links, agriculture and efficient resource use. ”
A final-status agreement should respect the sentiments and address demands of all affected parties.
The key to finding a solution to this issue lies with the affected parties.
India supports all efforts to find an acceptable solution to all the pending issues, including Jerusalem.
I assume the question refers to our embassy in Tel Aviv.
We will take a decision on that after both sides have come to an agreement on Jerusalem.”
We will adopt all measures necessary to unlock the innovation and entrepreneurial potential of our youth.
Israel’s capabilities offer a good match for our flagship schemes like Clean Ganga [the effort to clean the Ganges River] and Smart Cities.
Israeli technologies could also be used to improve the quality of lives of hundreds of thousands of people in our country if Israeli innovators remodel their products according to the needs of our rural population.
It is important to understand market trends among the rural sections.”
Business cultures in the two countries are unique and have evolved from their respective context in which each has evolved.
There may be differences in their approach but the Indian and Israeli businessmen whom I know have told me that both have similar scientific temperament.
Our perspective on innovation may be varied by but we both rely on it to add wealth and value to our societies.
Israelis and Indians are innovative by birth.
India and Israel both support and sustain unique innovation ecosystems.
Our common effort is also to link the creativity of innovation with the energy of entrepreneurship.
It is more than a buyer-seller relationship.
We are more interested in a tech-based partnership with an emphasis on ‘Make in India.’
The Israeli industry has been fairly positive to many of our flagship schemes like ‘Clean Ganga.’

This morning, I was delighted to join thousands of people from different walks of life, to celebrate this occasion, in the beautiful city of Dehradun, in the foot-hills of the Himalayas.
It has become an integral part of public life in many countries.
 
Second, it is an occasion when those, who are already introduced to Yoga, re-dedicate themselves to its pursuit.
The third theme is to spread the good word.
Thousands of individuals and institutions, who have already gained from Yoga, reach out to those that still have not.
 
 
Therefore, this surge of interest in Yoga, fills me with hope.
 
I am happy that you have chosen the International Day of Yoga, for the inauguration of this Nature Cure Centre.
I hope that this Centre shall strive to strongly integrate elements of Yoga, in all its programmes and initiatives.
Traditional Indian knowledge systems, such as Yoga and Ayurveda, help us stay healthy.
 
These are systems, which treat individuals with care and respect.
Their approach is neither intrusive nor abrupt.
 
Modern lifestyle takes a toll on the body as well as the mind.
 
Healthcare specialists all over the world now appreciate the fact that systems like Yoga and Ayurveda can complement the conventional medicine system extremely well.
These holistic systems focus on wellness and disease prevention.
Adoption of these holistic practices leads to increased health and wellness in individuals and in communities.
 
This leads further to social discipline, and in turn to ethics and enduring values of life.
 
 
Now, modern science has stepped in to generate supporting evidence for this.
 
 
It would be no exaggeration to say that Yoga has been appreciated a lot by the Western world.
I am told that in USA alone, more than 20 million people are practicing Yoga and that this number is increasing at an average of five percent every year.
Several modern medical institutes of USA and Europe have adopted Yoga as an alternative or adjunct treatment for many disorders.
 
The Government of India is committed to implement evidence based traditional systems of healthcare in public health.
Our National Health Policy, announced last year, strongly focuses on the prevention of diseases.
We have also launched nation-wide programmes for the prevention and control of non communicable diseases.
India is a big country with the world’s second largest population.
The initiatives taken today may take some years to show results, but I am confident that tangible results will soon become visible.
It is also significant that their objective is life-long wellness.
I assume that respect for authenticity and faith in scientific approach are inherent to these objectives.
With such an approach, the Centre can contribute significantly to the wellness movement, and take the benefits of Yoga to a large number of people in the USA.

We are proud to be the global host for World Environment Day, 2018.
As we celebrate this important occasion today, we recall our ancient ethos of universal brotherhood.
This has been expressed in the famous Sanskrit phrase– VasudhaivaKutumbakam – the world is one family.
The same ethos was reflected in the doctrine of trustee-ship, advocated by Mahatma Gandhi.
He had said that ‘Earth provides enough to satisfy everyone’s need, but not enough for everyone’s greed.’
Our traditions have for long stressed the importance of living in harmony with nature.
India is the fastest growing economy in the world today.
We are committed to raising the standards of living of our people.
We are also committed to ensure, that we do so, in a way that is sustainable and green.
In this direction, we have given forty million new cooking gas connections in the last two years.
This has freed rural women from the misery of poisonous smoke.
It has also eliminated their dependence on firewood.
We are reducing dependence on fossil fuels.
We are switching sources of fuel where possible.
We are transforming cities and public transportation.
We are a young Nation.
To generate employment, we are working towards making India a global manufacturing hub.
As part of the Nationally Determined Contributions, India is committed to reducing thirty-three to thirty-five percent of emission intensity of its GDP during 2005 to 2030.
We are on track to meet the 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution.
According to the UNEP Gap Report, India is also on track to meet its Copenhagen Pledge.
We will reduce the emissions intensity of India’s GDP by twenty to twenty-five percent over 2005 levels by 2020.
We have a robust National Biodiversity Strategy.
We also recognize the need to tackle the issue of water availability, which is becoming a major challenge in India.
The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana has been launched to ensure that no farm goes without water.
Our motto is ‘More crop, per drop.’
We have also launched a massive campaign to ensure that our farmers convert agricultural waste to valuable nutrients instead of burning them.
While much of the world focuses on Inconvenient Truth, we have moved on to Convenient Action.
About three months ago, leaders from over 45 nations, and Heads of International Organizations, gathered here in New Delhi, for the Founding Conference of the International Solar Alliance.
 
Plastic now threatens to become a menace to humanity.
Plastic pollution is already having a deadly impact on our marine ecosystem.
Marine litter especially micro-plastic, is a major trans-boundary problem.
India is preparing to join the “Clean Seas Campaign” and make its contribution towards saving our oceans.
Plastic pollution is now entering into our food chain.
In fact, micro plastics have now even entered basic food like salt, bottled water and tap water.
The per capita plastic consumption in India is much lower than in many parts of the developed world.
Our national mission on cleanliness and sanitation – Swachh Bharat Abhiyan – has a special focus on “plastic waste management.”
Among its participants are United Nations, Union and State Governments, industry, and non-government organizations.
I hope they continue to do exemplary work in curbing plastic pollution.
Environmental degradation hurts the poor and vulnerable, the most.
This is not possible without ensuring that we all come together to protect what Mother Nature has given us.
The choices that we make today, will define our collective future.

It’s no less than our good fortune that all of us have gathered here in this manner on the occasion of Yoga day on this land of mother Ganges where four holy shrines are located, the land which was visited by AdiShankaracharya and whereSwami Vivekanandalso came several times.
Even otherwise, Uttarakhand has been the main centre for Yoga for several decades.
These mountains of Uttarakhand spontaneously inspire us for Yoga and Ayurveda.
Even a common man gets a unique diving feeling when he visits this place.
There is an incredible spirit, vibrations and magnetic power in this holy land.
It’s a matter of pride for all Indians that today as the rising sun will progress on its journey, as the sunrays will reach the earth and light is spread, in all those places people will welcome the sun with Yoga.
From Dehradun to Dublin, from Shanghai to Chicago, from Jakarta to Johannesburg, everywhere, there is Yoga all around.
Whether it is thousands of feet high mountains of Himalaya or be it desert area singed by sunlight, Yoga is flourishing the life in every situation.
When divisive powers gain prominence then it leads to disintegration.
It leads to division among the people, division among the societies and division among the countries.

Yoga helps to maintain balance amidst this disintegration.
It does the job of uniting us.
Yoga brings about peace in this modern fast paced life by combining the body, mind, spirit and soul.
It brings about peace in the family by uniting the person with the family.
It brings about a harmony in the society by making the family sensitive towards society.
Societies become the links for national integration.
And this kind of countries bring about peace and harmony in the world.
And humanity flourishes and gainstrength from this feeling of brotherhood.
It means Yoga unites individuals, families, societies, countries and the world and it unites the entire humanity.
If we start taking pride in our legacy and if we abandon those things which are out of sync with the time, and that kind of thing doesn’t last either.
However, what is appropriate as per the time and which is useful in making of the future, if we take pride in our great legacy of this kind then the world too will never hesitate in taking pride in that.
But if we don’t have any trust in our own strength and capabilities then no one will accept it.
If a family itself continues to demoralise a child in the family and if that family expects that the kid will be respected in the locality then it is not possible.
When parents, when family, when brothers and sisters, all of them accept a child as it is only then the neighbours also start accepting the child.
Today, Yoga has proved this thing that as India has once again attached itself to the power of Yoga, similarly, the world too has started attaching itself with the Yoga.
Today, Yoga has become one of the most powerful unifying forces in the world.
I can say it with full sense of confidence that today if we gather the number of people doing Yoga in the entire world then incredible facts will be revealed to the world.
People gathering for Yoga, people like you gathering for Yoga in different countries, in parks, in open grounds, on the sides of the roads, in offices and homes, in hospitals, in schools and colleges, in the historic buildings, have been providing further energy to the feeling of this universal brotherhood and global friendship.
Friends, the world has embraced Yoga and glimpses of this can be seen in the manner in which International Day of Yoga has been marked every year.
Infact, Yoga Day has become one of the biggest mass movements in the quest for good health and well-being.
Friends, from Tokyo to Toronto, from Stockholm to Sao Paulo, Yoga has become a positive influence in the lives of millions.
It has the best of our past and presents and a ray of hope for our future.
Ours is a world that never sleeps.
At every given point, there is something happening in a different part of the world.
A fast-paced existence brings with it lot of stress.
I was shocked to read that every year, almost 18 million people all over the world die due to heart-related diseases.
About 1.6 million people lose the fight against diabetes.
The way to lead a calm, creative and content life is Yoga.
It can show the way in defeating tensions and mindless anxiety.
Instead of dividing, Yoga always unites.
Instead of further animosity, Yoga assimilates.
Instead of increasing suffering, Yoga heals.
Practicing Yoga has the ability to herald an era of peace, happiness and brotherhood.
More people practicing Yoga means the world needs more people to teach it.
Over the last three years many individuals are teaching Yoga, new institutions are being set up and even technology is connecting people to Yoga.
I urge you all to build on this momentum in the times to come.
May this Yoga Day become an opportunity to deepen our connect with Yoga and motivate people around us to practice it.
This can be the enduring impact of this day.
Friends, Yoga has shown the path of wellness to the world from the path of illness.
This is the reason because of which the acceptance for Yoga throughout the world has been increasing so rapidly.
It has revealed in the studies conducted by Coventry University and Radboud University that Yoga not only provides relief to our bodies but it can also reverse those molecular reactions taking place in our DNA that cause illness and depression.
We can protect ourselves from several diseases in addition to having a good heath if we daily practice the poses and breathing exercise of Yoga.
Regular practice of Yoga has a direct bearing on the medical expenses of any family.
It is essential for us to stay healthy to join in the every activity, every process of the nation building and Yoga certainly has a big role in this thing too.
Therefore, today, I urge you people that those who have been practicing Yoga please make it regular, and those who could not start doing Yoga so far they must make an effort once.
Friends, the increasing spread of Yoga has brought the world to India and India to the world even closer.
The position that Yoga has got in the world due to constant efforts made by us that position will be further strengthened with the time.
It is our responsibility to further develop the understanding about Yoga for a healthy and happy humanity.
Please come forward, let us further intensify our efforts by keeping our responsibility in the mind.
From this holy land, I once again convey my best wishes to the Yoga enthusiast all over the world.
The Prime Minister remarked that most of the awardees are from rural and humble backgrounds.
He said that perhaps their daily struggles had helped instil resilience in them, to deal courageously in adverse situations.
The Prime Minister congratulated all the award winners, their parents and schoolteachers.
He also appreciated those, who recorded their instances of bravery, and helped draw attention to them.
Shri Narendra Modi said that after such recognition, future expectations from the awardees become higher than usual.
He wished them well in their future endeavours.
My heartiest greetings to countrymen on this pious, festive occasion.
We have seen how closely the power of ‘Ram Naam’, the chant of Lord Ram’s name, permeated every moment of revered Bapu’s life.
This signifies that Ram & Ramayan continues to inspire and have a positive impact, not just in India, but in that part of the world too.
Once again, my best wishes to all of you on the occasion of Ramnavami.
My dear countrymen, just like every time earlier, I have received a rather large number of letters, e mails, phone calls and comments from you.
I read a post written on MyGov by Komal Thakkar ji, where she has referred to starting on-line courses for Sanskrit.
Alongwith being IT professional, your love for Sanskrit has gladdened me.
I have instructed the concerned department to convey to you efforts being made in this direction.
I shall also request listeners of Mann Ki Baat who are engaged in the field of Sanskrit, to ponder over ways & means to take Komalji’s suggestion forward.
Shriman Ghanshyam Kumar ji of Village Baraakar, District Nalanda, Bihar – I read your comments written on the Narendra Modi App.
The concerns you have raised on the depleting ground water levels is indeed of great importance.
Shriman Sakal Shastriji, you mentioned ‘Karnataka’… you beautifully maintained a delicate balance between words when you wrote ‘Ayushman Bharat’; ‘Long live India’ will be possible only when we express ‘Ayushman Bhoomi; ‘Long live the land’; and that will be conceivable only when we begin feeling concerned about every living being on this land.
You have urged one and all to retain and keep aside some water for birds & animals, during summer time.
Sakal ji, I have conveyed your sentiments to our listeners.
Shriman Yogesh Bhadresha Ji has asked me to speak to the youth concerning their health.
He feels that our youth are physically weak, compared to those of other Asian countries.
Yogesh ji, I feel I should speak in detail to all of you on ‘Fit India’.
In fact, all you young people can come together to launch a movement of Fit India.
And it is his heart felt desire to see all those photos & videos being shared on social media.
Prashant ji, the Government of India has already done that on social media and the Narendra Modi App, beginning that very day.
You may now like them, re-tweet them, post them to your friends.
Anagha, Jayesh and many other children from Chennai have written & posted to me their heartfelt thoughts on the gratitude cards, the post script to the book ‘Exam Warriors’.
Let me tell Anagha, Jayesh & other children that these letters enliven me up after a hard day’s work.
Now, if I start including all those phone calls, comments, whatever I could read or hear, many of which touched my heart; if I exclusively speak about them, perhaps I’ll require a few months to respond to them in some way or the other.
This time, maximum number of letters are from children who have written about exams.
They have shared their vacation plans.
They’ve expressed their concern on the availability of water for birds & animals.
Our farmer brothers & sisters have written on Kisan Melas, Farmer Carnivals and activities revolving around farming, being held across the country.
Quite a few active citizens have sent in suggestions on the subject of water conservation.
And why should not things change?
In utterances of yours, in your experiences, in the examples that you quote, there exists immense inspiration, unfathomable energy, unparalleled warmth; a resolve to bring about something new for the country.
In a way, this is endowed with the might to transform the entire season-cycle of the country.
When I get to read in your letters how a rickshaw puller from Karimgunj in Assam, Ahmed Ali, has built nine schools for underprivileged children, I witness firsthand the indomitable will-power this country possesses.
In this mission of his, Saidul sold off family jewellery and raised funds through charity.
His cab passengers too contributed large-heartedly.
A young engineer girl donated her first salary for this noble cause.
This is the power of New India.
Today the whole world has changed the way it looks at India.
The name ‘India’ now evokes a sense of awe & respect; the reason behind it is the ‘Purusharth’, the resolute yet selfless inner strength of such illustrious sons & daughters of Mother India.
Today, the entire country, the youth, women, the marginalized, the underprivileged, the middle class, in fact every section has awakened to a new confidence … YES, we can go forward, the country can take great strides.
An atmosphere of positivity built on a self confidence filled with hope has pervaded all over.
This self confidence, this very positivity will by a catalyst in realising our resolve of New India, of making our dream come true.
My dear countrymen, the coming months are very crucial for our farming brothers and sisters.
That is why a large number of letters on agriculture have been received.
This time, I requisitioned and viewed videos of discussions with our farmers on DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan and I feel that each farmer should get connected to this DD Kisan Channel of Doordarshan, view it and adopt those practices in his/ her own farm.
From Mahatma Gandhi to Shastri ji, Lohia ji, Chaudhari Charan Singh ji, Chaudhari Devi Lal ji – they all recognized agriculture and the farmer as vital aspects of the nation’s economy and also for the common man’s life.
I recently visited the Krishi Unnati Mela organized in New Delhi.
This state has a small area but it has attained a grand success.
Our farmers in Meghalaya, in the year 2015-16, achieved record production as compared to the last five years.
They have showed that if once the targets are set, spirits are high and with a strong resolve, the set targets can most certainly be attained.
Today, the farmers have technology to help them while they work hard in their fields.
It has been decided that the MSP of notified crops will be fixed at least one and a half times of their cost.
If I may elaborate on this, MSP will include labour cost of other workers employed, expenses incurred on own animals and cost of animals and machinery taken on rent, cost of seeds, cost of each type of fertilizer used, irrigation cost, land revenue paid to the State Government, interest paid on working capital, ground rent in case of leased land and not only this but also the cost of labour of the farmer himself or any other person of his family who contributes his or her labour in agricultural work will also be added to the cost of production.
Moreover, an extensive exercise on agricultural reforms is being undertaken across the country in order to ensure that our farmers get a fair price for their crop.
Efforts are on to connect local village mandis to wholesale market and then on with the global market.
Twenty- two thousand rural haats in the country will be upgraded by creating the necessary infrastructure and these will be integrated with APMC and e-NAM platform- so that the farmers would not have to go to distant places for selling their produce.
In other words, such a system is being set up where in farms in any part of the country will have a market-connect.
My dear countrymen, this year Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary celebrations will begin.
How should the country celebrate it?
Swachch Bharat is already our resolve; besides this, how can our 125 crore countrymen pay the best tribute to Gandhiji by working in close harmony?
Preventive health care is the least costly and the easiest one as well.
And, the more we become aware about preventive health care, the more beneficial will it be for the individuals, the family and the society.
The first necessity for a healthy life is cleanliness.
All of us took up the responsibility and the result is that in the last four years or so, sanitation coverage has almost doubled and risen to around 80 percent.
I will share these videos with you so that we may do aasans and pranayam together.
Efforts are being extensively undertaken to make health care accessible and affordable, make it easily accessible and affordable for the common man.
Presently, more than three thousand Jan Aushadhi Kendras have been opened across the country and more than eight hundred medicines are being made available there at an affordable price.
 
I appeal to the listeners of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ to provide this information about Jan Anshadhi Kendras to the needy ones – it will cut their expense on medicines.
 
The cost of heart stent for heart patients has been reduced to 85%.
 
Under ‘Ayushman Bharat Yojana ‘, the Government of India and insurance companies will jointly provide 5 lakh repees for treatment to about 10 crore families or say 50 crore citizens per year.
In the present 479 medical colleges, MBBS seats have been increased to about 68 thousand.
 
One new medical college will be set up for every three districts.
A target has been fixed to make the country TB-free by 2025.
This is an enormous task.
Your cooperation is needed to create public awareness.
All of us will need to make united efforts to become TB-free.
My dear countrymen, April 14 is the birth anniversary of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar.
Years ago, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar spoke of India’s industrialization.
According to him the industry was an effective medium by which jobs could be made available to the poorest of the poor and the poorer.
 
Today India has emerged as a bright spot in the global economy and today the highest foreign direct investment or FDI in the world, is flowing to India.
 
That the development of industries could only be possible in the cities, was the kernel of the idea of Dr. Baba Sahib Ambedkar and that was the reason he banked upon urbanization of India.
 
Today, we have adopted in all aspects of governance the mantra of co-operative federalism and going a step further, we have adopted competitive cooperative federalism but most importantly, Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar is an inspiration for millions of people like me, who belong to backward classes.
 
But, the picture of New India is altogether different.
 
 
 
I urge you all to be a part of this campaign.
The day of Bhagwan Mahavir’s birth anniversary is a day to remember his sacrifice and penance.
The life and philosophy of Lord Mahavirji, the apostle of non-violence will inspire us all.
 
The very mention of Easter reminds us of the inspirational preaching of Lord Jesus Christ which has always impressed on mankind the message of peace, harmony, justice, mercy and compassion.

The experts appreciated the unique initiative of this kind of a dialogue, which brings various stakeholders together on policy matters.
Interacting with the global leaders of the energy sector, Prime Minister highlighted the significant positioning of India in the oil and gas market.
 
This will help stabilise the global economy which is on path of recovery.
 
Firstly, he highlighted that the consuming countries, due to rising crude oil prices, face many other economic challenges including serious resource crunch.
 
He appealed to oil producing countries to channel their investible surplus to pursue commercial exploitation in oil sector in the developing countries.
 
 
 
Lastly and importantly, he requested for review of payment terms so as to provide temporary relief to the local currency.
Prime Minister also spoke about the various policy initiatives and developmental measures undertaken by his Government in the sector.
He highlighted the liberalisation in gas pricing and marketing which has been particularly in deep waters and requiring technology for high pressure high temperature exploitation.
He made a mention of open acreage licensing policy, early monetisation of coal bed methane, incentives for discovery of small fields and seismic survey at a national level.
Members of the Palestinian and Indian delegations,
Members of the Media, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Sabah-al-kher (Good Morning)
It is a matter of great happiness for an Indian Prime Minister to come to Ramallah for his first ever visit.
President Abbas, I would like to thank you for the words that you said in my honor and also for the very warm and grand welcome extended to me and my delegation.
Excellency, you have very cordially bestowed me with the highest honor of Palestine.
The old and strong historical relations between India and Palestine have stood the test of time.
 
 
 
He was among the top leaders of his time.
His role in Palestinian struggle is unprecedented.
Abu Omar was also a distinguished friend of India.
Visiting the museum dedicated to him has also been an unforgettable experience for me.
Once again I offer my heartfelt tributes to Abu Omar.
Ladies & Gentlemen,
Remarkable courage and perseverance has been displayed by the people of Palestine in the face of constant challenges and crises.
The difficulties and challenges against which you have moved ahead is really commendable.
We appreciate your spirit and your faith in your efforts for a better tomorrow.
India is a very old ally in Palestine’s nation-building efforts.
We have cooperation in the areas of training, technology, infrastructure development, project assistance and budgetary support.
As a part of our new initiative, we have started a Technology Park project here in Ramallah which is currently under construction.
We believe that this institute will emerge as a world-class training institute for the young diplomats of Palestine.
Our capacity building cooperation involves mutual training for long and short-term courses.
Training and scholarship slots for Palestine in leading Indian educational institutions of different sectors such as finance, management, rural development and information technology were recently extended.
I am happy that during this visit we are extending our development cooperation.
India will continue to invest in Palestine in the projects of health, educational infrastructure and women empowerment center and also in a printing press.
We consider this contribution as building blocks for the creation of an energetic Palestine State.
At the bilateral level, we have agreed to make our relations deeper through the Ministerial level Joint Commission Meeting.
Last year, for the first time, there was an exchange between the youth delegations of India and Palestine.
Investing in our youth and cooperating in their skill development and relationships is a shared priority.
They are our future and inheritors of our friendship.
I am happy to announce that we will increase the exchange of young persons from 50 to 100 from this year.
In our discussion today, I once again assured President Abbas that India is committed to take care of the interests of the Palestinian people.
India hopes that Palestine soon becomes a sovereign and independent country in a peaceful atmosphere.
President Abbas and I had discussions on recent regional and global developments related to the peace and security of Palestine and its peace process.
India greatly hopes for peace and stability in this region.
We believe that permanent solution to the issue of Palestine is ultimately contained in negotiations and understanding through which a path to a peaceful coexistence can be obtained.
 
We know it is not easy.
But we must constantly keep on trying because there is so much at stake.
Your Excellency, I express my heartfelt gratitude for your wonderful hospitality.

He was steadfastly committed to the welfare of Tamils and ensured that Tamil Nadu’s voice was effectively heard.
I have had the opportunity of interacting with Karunanidhi Ji on several occasions.

I am glad that today, an auspicious opportunity allows me to share some thoughts with you.
It laid the foundations of Quantum Statistics and a basis for modern Atomic Theory.
Einstein’s biographer Abraham Pace regarded his work as one of the last four revolutionary papers on old Quantum Theory.
The name of Satyendra Nath Bose has been immortalized in the history of science by concepts and terms, like Bose Statistics, Bose Einstein Condensation and Higgs Boson.
The fundamental importance of his work may be gauged from the fact that several Nobel Prizes in Physics have been awarded subsequently to researchers carrying forward his ideas to diverse physical applications.
Professor Bose was a crusader for teaching of science in vernacular languages.
He started the Bengali science magazine Gyan-o-Bigyan.
To promote understanding and love of science in our youth, it is vital that we promote science communication in a big way.
I am told that our science departments are now working on a multipronged approach.
I understand that a portal is being developed for sharing of scientific infrastructure that would allow transparent and efficient tagging and sharing of resources.
A mechanism is being put up for strong collaborations between academic and R&D institutions.
City based R&D Clusters are being created to bring together all Science and Technology partners from Academia to Institutes, to Industries to Startups.
The success of this effort, will depend on our ability to bring all institutions and labs under this strategy.
It requires whole-hearted support from each of us.
We cannot miss similar opportunities today.
Upcoming sectors such as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Cyber-physical systems, Genomics, and Electric Vehicles are new challenges that require your attention.
Please ensure, that as a country, we keep pace with these emerging technologies and innovations.
The way our scientific community tackles these challenges, will determine our success in smart manufacturing, smart cities, Industry 4.0, and the Internet-of-Things.
Brilliant ideas retain their relevance far beyond the time that they were mooted.
Even today, the work of Acharya Bose continues to inspire scientists.

Till date more than 200 such visits have taken place by the Union Ministers.

These two battalions will directly provide job opportunities to about 2,000 youth in the State.

I welcome Prime Minister Netanyahu and members of the Israeli Delegation on behalf of all my countrymen.
It is an added pleasure to be with the CEOs of both countries.
Prime Minister Netanyahu and I have just completed a fruitful interaction with Indian and Israeli business leaders through the bilateral CEOs Forum.
I have high hopes from this interaction and partnership of CEOs, which started last year.
I have always had a deep regard for Israel and its people.
It was a very special visit.
I experienced at close quarters the remarkable spirit of innovation, enterprise and perseverance that drives Israel.
There is new energy and purpose that has in-vigorated our ties over the last few years.
It will help take our cooperation to greater heights.
The role of business and industry is crucial in the transformation of our ties.
It is your combined efforts that will add real value to our interaction and produce concrete successes.
Given the scale of the Indian economy and the relevance of cutting-edge Israeli technologies for us, even sky is not the limit for what we may achieve together!
This Fund, to be utilized over a period of 5 years, is a welcome opportunity to combine the talent pool of the two countries in pursuit of path-breaking technological solutions that can be commercially exploited.
I strongly encourage enterprises in both countries to utilize this platform.
Equally exciting is the pick up in science and technology exchanges through joint R&D projects such as in areas like “Data Analytics” and “Cyber Space security”.
I am happy to note that the India-Israel Innovation and Technology Conclave is going to be held in India in July 2018.
I hope this Conclave will spur co–development of new technologies.
In fact, the ground-work for this will be started from iCREATE day after tomorrow.
We are both going to Gujarat to inaugurate this campus, which is being developed as a leading innovation hub.
I am taking Prime Minister Netanyahu to rural areas of Gujarat because the real power of technology and innovation lies in the benefit it brings to the common man.
Israel is universally known as the Start-up nation with a unique eco-system for innovation and incubation.
The credit for this goes to the Israeli entrepreneurs.
You have made Israel a strong, stable and innovative economy.
You have made a country of 8 million people, shine as a global power-house of technology.
In fact, hailing from a water deficient state in India, I have particularly admired Israel’s water efficiency.
In India, we have been taking steady steps over three years at both macro as well as micro-level, to make a difference.
Our motto is: Reform, Perform and Transform.
The results are two-fold.
On the one hand, our procedures, processes and systems are getting aligned with the best in the world.
 
In spite of deep structural reforms, we are among the fastest growing major economies.
FDI inflows are at an all-time high, with 40% rise.
Tremendous work is being done to skill and employ the youth.
65% of our population is below 35 years of age and is hungry for technology-enabled growth.
This is our greatest opportunity as well as challenge.
For this purpose, we have started the Start-up India campaign.
There is vast potential for India-Israel partnership in this area.
The India-Israel Innovation Bridge will act as a link between the Start-ups of the two sides.
There would be many ideas and technologies that can be useful for or can be commercially scaled up in India.
We are positioning India as a global manufacturing hub leveraging the energy of our youth.
The ‘Make in India’ initiative is designed to help achieve this.
Through these initiatives, combined with the new eco-system of a formal economy and a unified tax regime, we are trying to create a NEW INDIA.
We are particularly keen to develop India into a knowledge-based, skill-supported and technology-driven society.
A grand beginning has already been made through Digital India and Skill India.
To enable this transformation, in the last few years, my Government has undertaken substantial reforms.
We have resolved a number of regulatory and policy issues facing the businesses and companies.
We have worked sincerely on ‘ease of doing business’ in India.
The results are there to see:
More than 90 percent of the FDI approvals have been put on automatic route.
We are now among the most open economies.
Every day we are making it easier to do business in India.
In taxation, we have carried out a number of historic reforms.
The path breaking GST reform has been introduced successfully and smoothly.
Several Israeli companies have joined hands with Indian companies for Making in India.
Many others, especially those with advanced water technologies and agri techniques, defence and security systems, and pharma knowledge have a foot-hold in India.
Similarly, Indian companies have significant presence in several sectors in Israel like IT, Irrigation and Pharma.
Diamond remains a strong link in our trade.
There are more business joint ventures today than before.
However, this is just the beginning.
Our trade with Israel has grown to more than 5 billion dollars.
But this is still well below the real potential.
We must attain the full potential of our ties.
This is not only a diplomatic imperative but also an economic one.
Just to give you an example:
Imagine the environmental and economic gains if we can collaborate to save wastage and if we can add value in our fruits, vegetables and horticulture!
Similar is the case with water.
We have situations of plenty as well as scarcity of water.
We have situations of food being thrown away even as there are many who go hungry.
India’s development agenda is huge.
It presents a vast economic opportunity for Israeli companies.
I invite more and more Israeli people, businesses and companies to come and work in India.
Along with the Government and people, the business community of India too is keen to join hands.
I wish your companies and ventures all success.
I assure you of my support and that of my Government wherever it is required.
And I thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for his continuous support in fast-tracking India-Israel trade and economic collaboration.

The Prime Minister expressed hope that the new building would help in better coordination and integration in the working of CIC.
Talking about the launch of the mobile App of the CIC, the Prime Minister said this would enable citizens to file appeals with ease, and enable them to easily access information being made available by the Commission.
The Prime Minister said democratic and participative governance requires transparency and accountability.
He said CIC plays a key role in this regard.
He said such institutes work as catalysts for trust-based governance.
The Prime Minister said that an “empowered citizen” is the strongest pillar of our democracy.
He said the first pillar is to ask questions (Sawaal).
In this context, he mentioned the MyGov citizen engagement platform.
The second pillar is listening to suggestions (Sujhaav).
He said the Government is receptive and open to suggestions received from CPGRAMS or on social media.
The third pillar is interaction (Sanvaad).
The fifth pillar is information (Soochna).
The Prime Minister said that it is the Government’s duty to inform citizens about its actions.
He said the Government has begun a new practice of providing information through real-time updated, online dashboards.
Information on progress of schemes such as Saubhagya and Ujala has been made available, he said.
The Prime Minister said information commonly asked for is being uploaded on web portals of the concerned departments and Ministries.
He said digital technology is being used to improve transparency and quality of citizen services.
Similarly, projects are being tracked in real-time.
He said that in a meeting of PRAGATI last week, the progress of reconstruction works at Kedarnath was monitored through a drone camera.
He said the PRAGATI meetings have helped speed up projects worth over 9 lakh crore rupees.
He said that in the quest for rights, it is important not to forget duties.
I am particularly pleased that with Prime Minister Mark, his four Cabinet colleagues, the Mayor of the Hague and more than 200 business representatives have also come to India.
This is the largest business delegation to have come to India from Netherlands.
And it clearly shows how much dynamism is there in our trade and investment relationship.
Today, both of us reviewed the progress in our bilateral relations.
Last year when I went to Netherlands, I had urged my friend Mark to think positively on becoming a member of the International Solar Alliance.
The expertise, the technology and the experience which Netherlands has in the field of solar power, whole world should benefit from it.
And I am happy that today Netherlands has become a member of the International Solar Alliance.
I express my gratitude to Prime Minister Rutte for this decision.
India is not new to Dutch companies.
Hundreds of Dutch companies have been working in India for many years.
Waste Water Management projects in Vadodara and Delhi are making good progress.
We are completing 10 years of cooperation in Science & Technology, and this successful partnership will be further strengthened by participation of Netherlands as a Partner Country in the Tech Summit, which will be held in India in 2019.
Providing special attention to the issues of Indian society living abroad has been a major priority of my government’s foreign policy.
I specifically thank Prime Minister Rutte and the Government of Netherlands for the assistance in safe extraction of Indian nationals at the time of hurricane that came in Sint Maarten in September 2017.
Once again I very warmly welcome you and your delegation in India.
To inaugurate 106th edition of Indian Science Congress in Jalandhar

Heartiest greetings to all fellow citizens on this auspicious occasion.
The festival of Rakshabandhan symbolizes the bond of love & trust between a brother & a sister.
For centuries, this festival has proved to be a shining example of social harmony.
In the nation’s history, there are innumerable accounts of this sacred thread, binding together people of distant lands, different religions, around a spindle of trust.
In a few days from now, we shall celebrate the festive occasion of Janmashtami.
The whole atmosphere will reverberate to the sonorous chants & calls of ‘Hathi, Ghoda, Palki’, ‘Jai KanhaiyaLalki’ and ‘Govinda-Govinda’.
It is indeed an extremely joyous experience to imbue the essence of Bhagwan Krishna & revel blissfully.
Sanskrit language & literature encompasses a storehouse of knowledge pertaining to every facet of life.
For example, in order to illustrate the significance of the Guru in one’s life, it has been said
I earnestly pray for those injured in this natural disaster to get well soon.
I firmly believe that the sheer grit and courage of the people of the state will see Kerala rise again.
From Kutch to Kamrup, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, everyone is endeavoring to contribute in some way or the other so that wherever a disaster strikes, be it Kerala or any other part of India, human life returns to normalcy.
Irrespective of age group or area of work, people are contributing.
Everyone is trying to ensure speedy mitigation of the sufferings people in Kerala are going through, in fact sharing their pain.
We know that jawans of our armed forces are the vanguards of rescue & relief operations in Kerala.
They have left no stone unturned as saviors of those trapped in the floods.
The Air Force, Navy, Army, BSF, CISF, RAF, every agency has played an exemplary role in the rescue & relief operations.
I would like to specially mention the arduous endeavors of the NDRF daredevils.
At this moment of hardship&agony, their service stands out as a shining example.
The capability, commitment & controlling situation through rapid decisions of the NDRF have made them a cynosure of every Indian’s eye, worthy of respect & admiration.
Once again on behalf of all Indians, I would like to re assure each & everyone in Kerala and other affected places that at this moment of calamity, the entire country stands by them.
My dear countrymen !
I was looking into the suggestions received for “Mann Ki Baat”.
He was a leader who gave up his position as Prime Minister fourteen years ago.
In a way, he was cut-off from active politics for the last 10 years.
The wave of love and faith that spread across the nation is an indicator of his great personality.
During these last days, many great aspects of Atalji came up to the fore.
This is certain.
India will remain ever grateful to Atalji for bringing the 91st Amendment Act, 2003.
This change brought about two important changes in India’s politics.
First one is that the size of the cabinet in states was restricted to 15% of the total seats in the state Assembly.
And the second one is that the limit under the Anti Defection Law was enhanced from one-thirds to two-thirds.
Besides, clear guidelines were defined to disqualify the defector.
For many years in India, the political culture of forming a very large cabinet was being misused to constitute jumbo cabinets not only to create a divide but also to appease political leaders.
Atalji changed it.
This effort of his resulted in saving of money as well as of resources.
This also helped in improving efficiency.
It could only be a visionary like Atalji who brought in this transformation and as a result of this, healthy traditions blossomed in our polity.
Atalji was a true patriot.
It was during his tenure that the timing of presenting the budget was changed.
Earlier, as was the British tradition, the Budget used to be presented at 5 pm because in London, Parliament used to start working at that time.
In the year 2001, Atalji changed the time of presenting the budget from 5 pm to 11 am.
One more freedom-the Indian Flag Code was framed in Atalji’s tenure and it came into effect in 2002.
A number of such rules have been included in this code which made it possible to unfurl the tricolor in public places.
This provided a chance to more and more of our countrymen to unfurl our national flag.
Thus, he brought our beloved tricolor closer to the commonman.
Similarly, you can see that presently efforts are afoot and discussions are being held about simultaneously holding the elections for Lok Sabha and for state assemblies.
The Government and the opposition – both are putting forth their view points.
This is a good development and a healthy sign for our democracy.
I must say that developing healthy traditions for a sound democracy, making constant efforts to strengthen democracy, encouraging open-minded debates would also be aappropriate tribute to Atalji.
Reiterating our resolve to fulfill his dream of a prosperous and developed India, I along with all of you pay tributes to Atalji.
The monsoon session of Parliament ended just a few days back.
You will be glad to know that the productivity of Lok Sabha remained 118 percent and that of Rajya Sabha was 74 percent.
All the members rose above party interests to make the Monsoon session most productive and this is why Lok Sabha passed 21 bills and in Rajya Sabha fourteen bills were passed.
This Monsoon session of Parliament will always be remembered as a session for social justice and youth welfare.
A number of importantbills beneficial to the youth and the backward classes were passed during this session.
As you know, a demand to constitute an OBC Commission similar to SC/ST commission was long pending for decades.
The country fulfilled its resolve this time to make an OBC Commission and also granted it Constitutional powers.
This step will prove to be the one to move forward our march towards achieving the goal of social justice.
An amendment bill to secure the rights of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes also were passed in this session.
This Act will give more security to the interests of SC and ST communities.
Those guilty of rape will get a minimum sentence of ten years and those found guilty of raping girls below the age of 12 years will be awarded the death sentence.
Recently, you might have read in newspapers, that a court in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh, after a brief hearing of two months, pronounced the death sentence on two criminals found guilty of raping a minor girl.
Earlier, a court in Katni in Madhya Pradesh awarded the death sentence to the guilty after a hearing of just five days.
Courts in Rajasthan have also taken similar quick decisions.
This Act will play an effective role in curbing crimes against women and girls.
Economic growth will be incomplete without a social transformation.
When we move ahead in the national interest, a change in the lives of the poor, the backward, the exploited and the deprived ones can also be brought about.
In the Monsoon session, this time, everyone jointly presented an ideal approach.
Today, I publicly express my heartfelt gratitude to all MP’s.
My dear countrymen!
The attention of crores of Indians is focused on the Asian Games being held in Jakarta.
Every morning, first of all, people look for newspapers, Television, News and Social Media to check Indian playerswinning medals.
The Asian Games are going on.
I wish to congratulate all players who have won medals for the country.
I extend my best wishes to thoseplayers who are yet to compete.
Among those winning medals for our country are a large number of our daughters which is a very positive sign; so much so, that youngsters of only 15-16 years of age have brought honour to our country by winning medals.
This too is a very positive indication that most of the medal-winners hail from small towns and villages and these players have achieved this success by putting in sheer hard work.
We shall celebrate National Sports Day on 29th August and I extend my best wishes to all sport lovers and also pay my tributes to the legendary hockey wizard Shri Dhyanchandji.
I request every citizen to make it a point to play and take care of their fitness because only a healthy India will build a developed and prosperous India.
When India will be fit, only then India’s future will be bright.
Once again, I congratulate the medal winners at the Asian Games and also wish the remaining players perform well.
Would you believe if someone tells you that about a thousand years ago, an over sixty metrestall pillar of granite was built and anothergranite rock weighing about 80 tonnes was placed over its top.
But, Brihdeshwar temple of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu is the place where this unbelievable combination of Engineering and Architecture can be seen.
Anybody will feel overawed on seeing Rani Ki Vaav of the 11th Century in Patan in Gujarat.
Our land has been an engineering laboratory.
There have been several engineers in India who made the unimaginable possible and presented such marvels of engineering before the world.
In this lineage of great engineers, we were blessed with a diamond whose work is still a source of wonder for all.He was Bharat Ratna Dr. M. Visvesvaraya.
Lakhs of farmers and common people continue to benefit from the Krishna Raj Sagar Dam built by him.
He is greatly revered in that part of our country and the whole nation remembers him with great respect and regard.
In his memory, 15th September is observed as Engineers Day.
Following his footsteps, our engineers have created their own identity in the world.
But, you did not find any damage anywhere.
These houses were built by our ancestors in sync with nature and surroundings of this place”.And she was saying all this with such a feeling of pride that it made me think that engineers in that era had constructed such structures according to the local situations which kept the commonman safe and secured.
While observing Engineers Day, we should think of the future as well.
The world is facing natural calamities.

The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi will inaugurate the Conference on Academic Leadership on Education for Resurgence on 29th September 2018 at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi in which the Vice-Chancellors/Directors from more than 350 universities are participating.
This event is being organized jointly by UGC, AICTE, ICSSR, IGNCA, IGNOU, JNU and SGT University.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, today laid the foundation stone of various projects of the Government of India and Government of Jharkhand, at an event in Sindri.
These include:
The poor will get access to top quality healthcare, he added.
Through ‘Mann Ki Baat’, I once again have been blessed with the opportunity to be face-to-face with you.
I am sure you distinctly remember that for the last many months, a naval team comprising six women Commanders was on a voyage.
I want to tell you something about the ‘Naavika Saagar Parikrama’.
They traversed a multitude of oceans, many a sea, over a distance of almost twenty two thousand nautical miles.
This was a first of its kind event in the entire world.
Last Wednesday, I got an opportunity to meet these daughters and listen to their experiences.
Once again, I congratulate these daughters and their spirit of adventure for bringing laurels to the country, for raising the glory of the Navy and significantly so, for conveying to the world that India’s daughters are no less.
Who does not know of the sense of adventure?
I congratulate these young friends and members of the school in Chandrapur, from the core of my heart.
Just a while ago, 16 year old Shivangi Pathak became the youngest Indian woman to scale Everest from the Nepal side.
Heartiest congratulations, Beti Shivangi.
Ajit Bajaj and his daughter became the first ever father-daughter duo to ascend Everest.
And it’s not that only the young are climbing Everest.
On the 19th of May, Sangeeta Bahal, aged more than 50, scaled the Everest.
 
A few days ago, under the ‘Clean Ganga Campaign’, a group from the BSF Scaled the Everest and while returning, removed loads of trash littered there and brought it down.
This deed is commendable indeed; it also displays their commitment towards cleanliness and the environment.
People have been ascending the Everest for years & many have managed to reach the peak successfully.
I congratulate these daredevils, especially the daughters from the core of my heart.
When I say ‘Fit India’, I believe that the more we play, the more we will inspire the country to come out & play.
People are sharing videos of Fitness Challenge on social media; they are tagging each other to spread the challenge.
Everybody is now getting connected with this Fit India Campaign.
People from the film fraternity, from the world of Sports, common citizens of the country, members of the armed forces, school teachers or even those toiling in fields and farms, their rising notes are building up a crescendo ‘Hum Fit toh India Fit’… ‘If we are fit, India is fit’.
For me, it’s heartwarming that the captain of the Indian Cricket team Virat Kohli ji has included me in his challenge… and I too have accepted his challenge.
It is played with cowries or tamarind seeds or dice on an eight by eight square board.
It used to be played in almost every state.
There is a season for flying kites.
While flying a kite or playing a game, one freely expresses one’s inherent unique qualities.
You must have seen many a child, shy by nature, leap up with zest, the moment a game begins.
Even children with a seemingly serious countenance start expressing themselves; while playing, the innate child within them comes to the fore.
It will not just be a loss of a game; it will be the loss of the spirit of childhood, something that will exist only in the verses of poetry.
My dear countrymen, on the 5th of June, our nation, India will officially host the World Environment Day Celebrations.
I appeal to all of you, that while trying to understand the importance of this theme, we should all ensure that we do not use low grade polythene and low grade plastics and try to curb the negative impact of plastic pollution on our environment, on our wild life and our health.
Let us all visit the World Environment Day website ‘wed-india 2018’ and try to imbibe and inculcate the many interesting suggestions given there into our everyday life.
Being sensitive towards nature, protecting nature, should come naturally to us; these virtues should be embedded in our sanskar.
In the past few weeks, we all witnessed that there were dust storms in the different regions of the country, along with heavy winds and unseasonal heavy rains.
There was also loss of life and property.
Thisobservation expressed centuries ago, straightaway implies that practicing yogic exercises on a regular basis leads to imbibing benefic attributes which stand by our side like relatives and friends.
The practice of yoga leads to building up of courage, which always protects us like a father.
The practice of yoga leads to germination of a sense of forgiveness in the same manner as a mother has for her children and mental peace becomes our permanent friend.
Bhartahari has said that with regular yogic exercise, truth becomes our child, mercy becomes our sister, self restraint our brother, earth turns in to our bed and knowledge satiates our hunger.
When so many attributes become one’s partner, then that yogi conquers all forms of fear.
In many parts of the country, our youth and farmers demonstrated their bravery whilst standing up against the injustice.
It is indeed sad that we kept on calling the events of 1857 only as a rebellion or a soldiers’ mutiny for a very long time.
In fact, May 1857 was not only evaluated as a minor historical incident but was also an attempt to dent our self-respect.
It was Veer Savarkar who boldly expostulated by writing that whatever happened in 1857 was not a revolt but was indeed the First War of Independence.
A wonderful account about Savarkarji has been given by our dear honorable Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji.
Our daughters, who were forced to sift through garbage and beg from home to home in order to earn a living – today they are learning sewing and stitching clothes to cover the impoverished.
This is an example where the daughters are stitching ordinary to good quality clothes for themselves and other families.
Along with this, they are undergoing a training course in skill development.
I wish all these daughters, brimming with hope and trust, a very bright future.
You must have realized that whenever we go to a tea shop, and enjoy tea there, a discussion with some of the customers automatically ensues.
A meagre tea vendor; today you will be surprised to know that the lives of more than 70 children are being illuminated through education due to his efforts.
The month of June is so hot that people anxiously wait for the rains, gazing towards the sky for the clouds to appear.
After an entire month of fasting during Ramzan, the festival of Eid is a harbinger of celebrations.
I hope that the festival of Eid will further strengthen the bonds of harmony in our society.
Heartiest felicitations to all of you.

I am happy to be here in Mumbai, for the Third Annual Meeting of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
We are happy to have this opportunity to deepen our engagement with the bank and its members.
AIIB started its financing operations in January 2016.
The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is a result of collaborative efforts of Asian countries to provide a better tomorrow to our people.
As developing countries, we share similar challenges.
One of them is to find resources for provision of infrastructure.
I am happy that the theme of this year’s Meeting is “Mobilizing Finance for Infrastructure: Innovation and Collaboration”.
Investments by AIIB in sustainable infrastructure can impact the lives of billions of people.
Asia still faces wide ranging disparities in access to education, healthcare, financial services and formal employment opportunities.
Regional multi-lateralism through institutions such as AIIB can play a central role in helping to raise resources.
Sectors such as energy and power, transportation, telecom, rural infrastructure, agriculture development, water supply and sanitation, environment protection, urban development, and logistics require long term funds.
The interest rates on these funds need to be affordable and sustainable.
With committed capital of 100 billion dollars and huge need for infrastructure in member countries, I take this opportunity to call upon AIIB to expand from financing 4 billion dollars, to 40 billion dollars by 2020 and 100 billion dollars by 2025.
This would require simpler processing, and faster approval.
It would also need high quality projects and robust project proposals.
I believe that India and AIIB are both strongly committed to making economic growth more inclusive and sustainable.
Such assets, having passed the stages of land acquisition and environment and forest clearances, are relatively de-risked.
Hence, for such assets, institutional investment from pension, insurance and sovereign wealth funds are likely to be more forthcoming.
Another initiative, is the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund.
This aims to channel investments from both domestic and international sources into infrastructure.
This Fund has received a boost with AIIB committing 200 million US Dollars for investment.
India is one of the most investor-friendly economies in the world.
Investors look for growth and macro-economic stability.
On each of these parameters, India is well placed and has performed very well.
Let me share with you, some of our experiences and achievements.
Our macro-economic fundamentals are strong with stable prices, a robust external sector and a fiscal situation firmly in control.
Despite rising oil prices, inflation is within the mandated range.
Global confidence in India’s economy is rising.
Total FDI flows have increased steadily – more than 222 billion US dollars have been received in the last four years.
As per UNCTAD’s World Investment Report, India continues to be one of the top FDI destinations in the world.
From the point of a foreign investor, India counts as an extremely low risk political economy.
The Government has taken a number of steps to boost investment.
We have liberalized the FDI regime.
Today, most sectors are on automatic approval route.
The Goods and Services Tax is one of the most significant systemic reforms that our country has undergone.
It works on the One Nation – One Tax principle.
It reduces tax cascading, increases transparency, and adds to logistics efficiency.
All of this makes it easier for the investor to do business in India.
These and other changes have been noticed by the global fraternity.
India has jumped 42 places in three years to enter the top hundred in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Report 2018.
The size and growth of the Indian market hold much potential.
For example, the housing programme in India targets ten million houses in urban areas.
This would be more than the total requirement of a lot of countries taken together.
Therefore the use of new technology in house construction would have added advantage, if tried in India.
Another example of scale would be the Renewable Energy Programme in India.
And we are well on course to exceed these targets.
We have added more capacity to renewable energy than conventional energy in 2017.
India is working on e-mobility.
The challenge before us is of technology, particularly with respect to storage.
We will be hosting a global mobility conference this year.
I hope that this will help us in moving forward.
In India, we are upgrading connectivity at all levels.
The Bharatmala scheme is aimed at improving road connectivity by constructing national corridors and highways.
The Sagarmala project has been undertaken for boosting port connectivity, port modernization and port-linked industries.
Dedicated Freight Corridors are being developed to mitigate the congestion of our railway network.
The Jal Marg Vikas project would augment capacity of navigation on National Waterways for internal trade carried through inland water transport.
Our UDAN scheme works towards regional airport development and improved air connectivity.
An area which I believe still remains untapped and needs attention is the possibility of utilising India’s large coastline for transportation and freight movement.
While we talk about the conventional concept of infrastructure, I must mention some of the modern day infrastructure on which India has worked.
Bharat Net is targeted at providing last mile internet connectivity in the country.
India has over 460 million internet users and 1.2 billion mobile phones in use.
We are promoting the use of digital payments.
Our United Payments Interface system or UPI along with BHIM App and RuPay Card has shown the true potential of digital economy in India.
Through the UMANG App, more than 100 public services have been made available to the citizens through their mobile phone.
Our Digital India Mission aims to bridge the rural-urban digital divide.
Agriculture is the lifeline of the Indian economy.
We are promoting investments in warehouses and cold chains, food processing, crop insurance and allied activities.
We are promoting micro-irrigation to ensure optimal use of water with increased productivity.
I would like AIIB to look into potential investment opportunities in this field and associate with us.
We aim to provide every poor and homeless household a house with toilet, water and electricity by the year 2022.
We are also looking at various strategies for effective waste management.
We have also recently launched Ayushman Bharat, our National Health Protection Mission.
This will provide a benefit cover of over 7000 dollars annually to more than 100 million poor and vulnerable families.
The resulting expansion of health care facilities will lead to the creation of a large number of jobs.
I see great untapped potential in this for investors.
The Indian story of economic resurgence closely mirrors that of many other parts of Asia.
In fact, we are now living through what many have termed the ‘Asian Century’.
A ‘New India’ is rising.
It is an India that stands on the pillars of economic opportunity for all, knowledge economy, holistic development, and futuristic, resilient and digital infrastructure.
We look forward to our continued engagement with our development partners including AIIB.

My Cabinet colleague Shri Ram Vilas Paswan Ji, Shri C.R. Chaudhary Ji, Secretary General, UNCTAD, Dr. Mukhisa Kituyi, and other dignitaries present here.
First of all, I congratulate all of you for this Regional Conference on an important subject like Consumer Protection.
This programme is being attended by representatives from South Asia, Southeast Asia and all the East Asian countries.
I welcome all of you to this programme.
This event is the first of its kind in South Asia.
Today, we all symbolise a shared heritage not only economically but also culturally.
Friends, in today’s modern era our traditional relationship has attained a new dimension.
Today’s event is a reflection of how seriously we understand the needs of our citizens, how hard we strive to overcome their difficulties.
Every citizen is a consumer too and hence this event symbolizes our collective determination.
The Posts in the organisational structure in the Kautilya period may be considered as Director of Trade and the Superintendent of Standards in today’s context.
Regardless of the nature of business, Consumer satisfaction should be the prime motive.
Friends, India is one of the first few countries to legislate Consumer Protection Act in 1986, just one year after adoption of UN Guidelines.
Protection of consumer interests is a priority of the government.
This is also reflected in our resolution of the New India.
Moving beyond Consumer Protection, New India will have Best Consumer Practices and Consumer Prosperity.
Friends, today we are in process of enacting a new Consumer Protection Act keeping in view the business practices and requirements of the country.
The proposed Act lays great emphasis on consumer empowerment.
Rules are being simplified to ensure that Consumer grievances are redressed in a time-bound manner and at least possible cost.
Stringent provisions are proposed against misleading advertisements.
A Central Consumer Protection Authority with executive powers will be constituted for quick remedial action.
We have enacted the Real Estate Regulatory Act for the protection of home buyers.
Earlier, consumers waited for years to get the possession of their homes as they would fall prey to unscrupulous builders.
There used to be ambiguity regarding the area of the flat.
Now after RERA, only registered developers can seek bookings only after getting all the required permissions.
Moreover, booking amount has been fixed only at 10 per cent.
Earlier, the builders used to divert the money received for bookings to other projects.
Now government has made a stringent provision that 70 per cent of the payment received from buyers will be kept in an “Escrow” account and this amount will be spent on that project only.
Similarly, the Bureau of Indian Standard Act has also been enacted.
Now any commodity or service related to public or consumer interest can be brought under compulsory certification.
This Act also has provisions to order recall of substandard products from the market and for compensation in case of loss or damages incurred by the consumer.
Recently, India has also implemented Goods and Services Tax-GST.
After GST, dozens of different types of indirect taxes in the country have been abolished.
Many Hidden Taxes have also gone away.
Now, the consumer knows how much tax he has paid to the state government and how much to the central government.
The queues of the trucks on the borders now no longer exist.
With GST, a new business culture is developing and in the long term consumers will be the biggest beneficiaries.
It is a transparent system in which no one can hurt the interests of the Consumers.
Friends, besides strengthening the interests of the consumers through the law, it is also necessary that the grievances of the people are promptly addressed.
In the last three years, our government has created a new eco-system for Grievance Redressal by making efficient use of technology.
The capacity of the National Consumer Helpline has been increased 4 times.
Portals and Social Media associated with Consumer Protection have also been integrated.
A large number of private companies have been connected to the portal.
I can confidently state that this govt. has used social media positively for Consumer Protection in India, as has never been done before.
Friends, in my view and in the vision of my govt. the scope of Consumer Protection is very broad.
Development of any country and consumer protection are complementary.
Good governance has an important role in taking the benefits of development to every citizen.
Ensuring delivery of rights and services to the deprived by the Government is also a way of protecting interests of the consumers.
Recently, a scheme has also been launched to provide electricity connection to every household of the country.
All these efforts are for providing Basic Lifeline support to people and to make their lives more comfortable.
Interests of consumers are not protected by merely giving them rights.
In India we are also working to formulate schemes which help consumers save money.
The poor and middle class in the country is benefitted most from these schemes.
You might also be aware that UNICEF has recently announced findings of a survey in India.

Friends, Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Pariyojna has been launched to provide affordable medicines to the poor.
More than 500 medicines have been included in the list of essential drugs and their prices have been reduced.
Capping prices of Coronary Stents have made them cheaper by up to 85 per cent.
Recently, prices of knee implants have also been brought under control.
This also is saving crores of rupees for the poor and middle class people.

Friends, keeping the inflation under control has caused economic benefits to the poor and middle class consumers.
Otherwise, the rate at which the Inflation was rising during previous government’s tenure it would have resulted in huge rise in the budget of the common citizen’s kitchen.
By strengthening the Public Distribution System through technology, it is also being ensured that the poor, who have the right to affordable food grains, get their due.

Friends, it is necessary that the consumers also understand their shared responsibilities towards the society and discharge their duties in this regard to achieve Sustainable Development Goals.
Here, on this occasion, I specially want to inform colleagues from other countries about Give-it-up campaign.
Subsidy is provided on LPG cylinders in our country.
On my appeal, within a short time of around one year, more than one crore people have given up their gas subsidy.
The savings thereon have been used in giving free gas connections to 3 crore households so far.
It is an example that how the shared contribution from each consumer benefits other consumers thus creating a positive environment in the society towards one’s duties.
Friends, Government is implementing Prime Minister Rural Digital Literacy Campaign for Digital Empowerment of Consumers living in rural areas of the country.
Under this scheme, one person each from 6 crore households is being made digitally literate.
This campaign will facilitate villagers for electronic transactions and availing Government services digitally.
Bharat Interface For Money – i.e. BHIM App has expanded digital payments in cities as well as in rural areas.
Friends, India is one of the world’s largest markets on the strength of the population of more than 125 crore and the fast growing middle class.
Through Make in India we are offering a platform to Global Companies to produce in India and to make better use of our huge human resource.
Friends, this is a first of its kind conference in this part of the world.
Every country represented here is engaged in its own way for protecting the interests of their consumers.
But we must also keep in mind that now with the increasing Globalization, the whole world is changing into a single market.
Therefore it is very important to learn from each other’s experiences, to explore the points of common understanding and to discuss the possibility of building a Regional Coalition for Consumer Protection through such an event.
Friends, Asian countries provide large business opportunities because of large consumer base of more than 4 billion, increasing purchasing power and young demographic profile.
Under these circumstances, a strong regulatory system in every country and information sharing is a must for sustaining consumer confidence.
A framework for cooperation is also necessary to expeditiously act in cases related to consumers from other countries.
This will enhance mutual trust and trade.
Creating a Structured Mechanism for Communication, Mutual Sharing of Best Practices, Creating New Initiatives for Capacity Building and Starting Joint Campaigns, are such areas which can be pursued in mutual interest.
Friends, strengthening of our emotional bonds will also strengthen our shared cultural and trade heritage.
Taking pride in our culture while respecting other cultures is part of our tradition.
Over the centuries, we have been learning from each other and Trade and Consumer Protection are also an integral part of this process.
I hope that keeping in view the future challenges a roadmap with a clear vision for moving forward will be prepared in this conference.
I am hopeful that we will also succeed in institutionalizing regional cooperation through this conference.

There are opportunities in so many areas now, the Prime Minister said.

In response, he said that competition should not be with others, but with one’s own record.
He said that when one competes with one’s own past record, then pessimism and negativity can easily be defeated.

The welfare of farmers was a priority in his life.
The Siddhganga Mutt regularily used to organise cattle and agricultural fairs.

I urge eminent people of the country to come forward and jointly contribute in campaigning for spreading awareness on voter registration and casting one’s vote on the day of polling.
My Dear Countrymen,
This great land, India, has given birth to innumerable great men, men whose deeds for the sake for humanity have been extraordinary, truly unforgettable.
On this occasion I was fortunate to get an opportunity to inaugurate a museum dedicated to heroes who fought in India’s freedom struggle.
You may be aware of the fact that inside Red Fort, many chambers and structures lay locked & unused for several decades after Independence.
Those very chambers have now been turned into exquisite museums.
A museum dedicated to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army; Yaad-e-Jalian, reminiscences of Jalianwala Bagh and 1857 – India’s first war of Independence constitute the premises of ‘Kranti Mandir’, that has been dedicated to the nation.
Every inch, every brick of these museums is redolent with the fragrance of our glorious history.
Tales of valour of the heroes of our freedom struggle emanating from every nook & corner of these museums inspire us to delve deeper into our history.
This was the very site where three heroic sons of Mother India – Col. Prem Sehgal, Col. Gurbaksh Singh Dhillon and Major General Shahnawaz Khan had to face a trial under British Rule.
On my visit to Kranti Mandir, Red Fort, as I was reflecting on memories of Netaji, his family members gifted me a special cap.
There was a time when Netaji used to wear it.
I dedicated that cap to the museum itself, for visitors to see and be inspired with the spirit of patriotism.
The fact is, stories of the valour and patriotism of our heroes should be told and re-told to our newer generations in ways more than one.
Just a month ago, on the 30th of December, I had gone to Andaman & Nicobar islands.
At an event, our tricolour was unfurled at the very site where Netaji Subhash Bose had unfurled it exactly 75 years ago.
In a similar manner, when the tricolour was hoisted at the Red Fort in October 2018, it surprised everyone, since conventionally, this is done on the 15th of August.
The occasion was the completion of 75 years of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
It gladdens me to see many places associated with illustrious sons of India being developed in Delhi.
Be it 26, Alipur Road, associated with Babasaheb Ambedkar, or the Sardar Patel museum or the Kranti Mandir!
Whenever you come to Delhi, you must pay a visit to these places.
I have always considered Radio as an effective means of connecting with people.
Similarly, Netaji shared a deep bond with the medium of Radio and he chose this very medium to converse with countrymen.
In 1942, Subhash Babu established Azad Hind Radio and through it he used to communicate with soldiers of the Indian National Army and other countrymen.
These words instantly stirred up listeners with a rush of a new energy, a new fervour.
In this very Kranti Mandir, a visual arts museum has been established.
India’s art & culture has been portrayed here in a very attractive way.
The museum has 4 historical exhibitions which display more than 450 paintings and artworks which are of three centuries vintage.
Exquisite works of great artists such as Amrita Shergill, Raja Ravi Verma, Avanindranath Tagore, Gaganendranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Jamini Roy, Sailoz Mukherjee have been exhibited.
And I also specially request you to visit the place and see for yourself the works of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore ji.
And the most unique aspect was that Gurudev Tagore did not ascribe any name to most of his works.
He believed that the person seeing his painting should comprehend the painting in totality, from his own perspective, understand the message imparted by him in the particularpainting.
His paintings have been on display in European countries, in Russia and in America.
I hope you will go and see his paintings in the ‘Kranti Mandir.’
My dear countrymen, India is a land of saints.
Our saints have conveyed the message of goodwill, equality and social empowerment through their thoughts and deeds.
Sant Ravidas proposed that if God was present in every human being, then it was not fair to categorize him on the basis of caste, creed and other sociological demarcations.
Guru Ravidas ji was born in the holy city of Varanasi.
That is, if your heart is pure, then the Absolute master resides within your heart.
Sant Ravidas ji has influenced people cutting across every segment and class of the social milieu whether it was the Maharana of Chittor or his Queen or Meerabai, everyone was his follower were followers.
I once again bow in reverence to Sant Ravidas ji.
The number of successful space missions attempted since the country’s independence till 2014 have been equal to those successfully completed in the past four years.

Our country is also using Space Technology in devices employed in saving assets and life.
The sky and stars have always enthralled children.
Our Space Program provides an impetus to the children to think big and reach across those boundaries, which were considered impossible till today.
In January about 6,000 players participated in 18 disciplines in the Khelo India Youth Games held in Pune.
Only when the local ecosystem of our sports will be strong i.e. only when our base will be strong, then only our youth will be able to perform their best in the country and across the world.
When the player performs his best at the local level,only then, he also shines globally.
This time in ‘Khelo India’, participants from every state have performed well at their individual level.
The life of many a medal winner is also immensely inspiring.
Over the past month, more than 50 lakh toilets have participated in this unique contest.
The name of this unique contest is “Clean beautiful Toilet”.
I appeal to all the Sarpanchs and village heads to take a lead in this campaign in their respective Panchayats.
And do share your “clean beautiful toilet” photos with me on #MylzzatGhar on social media.

Authorities are monitoring the situation very closely.
It is a great honour to be the first Head of Government to deliver the keynote address at Singapore Fintech Festival.
 
 
 
And, it is no surprise that in just its third year, this Festival is already the world’s largest.
Singapore has been a global hub for finance and, it is now taking a leap into the digital future of finance.
It was here, in June this year, that I launched India’s RuPay card and the first international remittance mobile app using India’s world class Unified Payment Interface or UPI.
 
● If you want to increase your VC funding by 20 percent, tell the investors that you are operating in the “fintech space”.
● But, if you really want the investors to empty their pockets, tell them that you are using “blockchain” .
It tells you of the excitement and promise of emerging technologies to transform the world of finance.
Indeed, history has shown that finance is often the first to embrace new technology and connectivity.
We are in an age of a historic transition brought about by technology.
From desktop to cloud, from internet to social media, from IT Services to Internet of Things,we have come a long way in a short time.
There is daily disruption in businesses.
And, it is creating boundless opportunities to transform lives.
I had said at the United Nations in 2014 that we have to believe that development and empowerment can spread with the same speed at which Facebook, Twitter or mobile phones have spread.
Across the world, that vision is rapidly changing into reality.
My government came to office in 2014 with a mission of inclusive development that would touch the lives of every citizen – the weakest in the remotest village.
Yet, we wanted to achieve this in months, not years that conventional wisdom suggested.
With the power of fintech and the reach of digital connectivity, we have started a revolution of unprecedented speed and scale.
To begin with financial inclusion has become a reality for 1.3 billion Indians.
We have generated more than 1.2 billion biometric identities – called Aadhaar or foundation – in just a few years.
With our Jan DhanYojana, we aimed to give a bank account to every Indian.
In three years, we have opened 330 million new bank accounts.These are 330 million sources of identity, dignity and opportunities.
Less than 50 percent of Indians had bank accounts in 2014; now, it is nearly universal.
So today, more than a billion biometric identities, more than a billion bank accounts and more than a billion cell phones give India by far the biggest public infrastructure in the world.
More than Rupees 3.6 lakh crore, or 50 billion dollars of benefits from government have reached the people directly.
No longer must a poor citizen in a remote village travel long distances or pay off middle-men to get her rights.
Now, millions who lived on the edge of uncertainty receive insurance in their accounts; and, have access to the security of pension in old age.
Banking has come to doorsteps even in remote villages through 400,000 micro ATMs based on Aadhaar.
And now, this digital infrastructure has helped launch the world’s largest healthcare scheme this year.
‘Ayushman’ will provide affordable health insurance to 500 million Indians.
It has also helped us extend 145 million loans for small entrepreneurs through Mudra scheme.
A worker collects wages or remits money home quickly without giving up a day’s work.
Every digital payment saves time.
It also helps improve tax collection and inject fairness in the economy.
Even more, digital payments are a gateway to a world of possibilities.
Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence are helping us build a whole range of value added services for people.This includes credit to those with little or no credit history.
Financial inclusion also extends to micro, small and medium enterprises.
They are all coming on the nation-wide Goods and Services Tax digital network, launched just over a year ago.
Banks are reaching out to them with credit.
Alternative lending platforms are offering innovative financing models.
They no longer have to look at informal markets for credit at high interest rates.
Digital technology is introducing transparency and eliminating corruption through innovations such as the Government e-Marketor GEM.
It is an integrated platform for purchases by government agencies.
It already has 600,000 products.Nearly 30,000 buyer organisations and more than 150,000 sellers and service providers are registered on the platform.
There is an explosion of fintech innovation and enterprise in India.
Our youth are developing apps that are making the dream of paperless, cashless, presence-less, and yet safe and secure, transactions possible for all.
That is the wonder of India Stack– simply the largest set of Application Programming Interface in the world.
They are using Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain and machine learning to create solutions for banks, regulators and consumers.
And, they are also embracing our nation’s social missions – from health and education to micro credit and insurance.
This enormous talent pool in India benefits from the ecosystem created by initiatives such as Digital India and Startup India, and by supportive policies, incentives and funding programmes.
It also helps that India has the largest data consumption in the world and the cheapest rates for data.And one of the top nations in fintech adoption.
So, I say this to all the fintech companies and startups – India is your best destination.
Likewise, India’s vast market can enable fintech products to achieve scale, reduce risks and costs, and go global.
In short, the Indian story shows six great benefits of fintech: Access ,inclusion; connectivity; ease of living; opportunity; and, accountability.
Across the world, from the Indo-Pacific to Africa to Latin America, we see inspiring stories of extraordinary innovation changing ordinary lives .
But, there is much to be done.
Our focus should be development of all, through , that is, development of the most marginalised.
We must bring the unbanked 1.7 billion people in the world into the formal financial market.
We must make banks and financial institutions more resilient in managing risks,fighting frauds and dealing with disruption of traditional models.
We have to use technology to improve compliance,regulation and supervision, so that innovation flourishes and risks are contained.
We must use fintech tools to combat money laundering and other financial crimes.
We also need to enhance awareness of the masses and educate them about the opportunities which inclusive policies and use of technology open up for them.
For this,fintech will need to be not merely a mechanism but a movement.
And, we have to address the inevitable questions of data ownership and flow, privacy and consent; private and public good; law and ethics.
This generation will shape the futurein the palm of every hand in the world.
At no time in history were we blessed with so many possibilities:
to make opportunities and prosperity a reality in a lifetime, for billions.
to make the world more humane and equal –between rich and poor, between cities and villages, between hopes and achievements.
Just as India will learn from others, we will share our experience and expertise with the world.
This is a common journey for all.

Of late, News of abundant rainfall has been steadily coming in.
And that is why it becomes our collective responsibility… Let us be lovers of nature, protectors of Nature, conservers of Nature… and thus, ensure spontaneous balance in her myriad bounty.
Come to think of it, recently an incident pertaining to a natural disaster attracted global attention, leaving every heart & mind perturbed.
All of you must have watched it on T.V… in Thailand a team of 12 teenaged football players and their coach went on an excursion to a cave.
Usually it takes a few hours to enter and exit that cave.
But destiny had different plans that day.
Barely had they entered deep into the cave that a sudden heavy downpour caused water logging at the inlet of the cave.
Their exit was completely blocked.
One can only imagine the predicament of these teenagers in the face of death, where every second was fraught with danger.
On the one hand they were struggling against all odds; on the other, the world over, humanity joined hands in expressing the noblest & the most righteous of human virtues.
The world over, people prayed for the safe & secure exit of these children.
The sense of responsibility & commitment, prevailing at every level was astonishing.
The government, their parents, family members, media, citizens of that country, each one of them displayed an awe-inspiring sense of peace and patience.
All of them came together as a team to accomplish their mission.
I feel the self-control exercised by each one of them in conduct is worth understanding and emulating.
During the operation, a sailor from Thailand Navy sacrificed his life.
The whole world is be wildered at the way they held on with courage and patience, without losing hope, despite the odds against them in the water-logged dark cave.
This proves that when humanity stands together, it creates wonders.
What is certainly required is focusing on your goal with a calm & steady demeanour and the will to strive.
A few days ago, the country’s beloved poet Neeraj Ji left us forever.
Neeraj ji was blessed with a special quality… it was a combination of hope, faith, a firm resolve and self-confidence.
Every word of Neeraj ji’s work can instill a lot of strength & inspiration in us Indians.
July is the month when the youth step into a new phase of life, where the focus shifts from questions and veers towards cut-offs.
The attention of students steers from home to hostel.
Students submit themselves to the tutelage of Professors vis a vis the shadow of their parents.
I firmly believe that my young friends must be enthusiastic & happy on the commencement of their college life.
Leaving home for the first time, moving out of one’s village, coming out of a protective environment amounts to taking charge of the course of one’s life.
This multitude of young people leave their homes for the first time to chart a new direction for their lives.
Some students might have joined their respective colleges and some must be about to join.
All I would like to say to you is ‘Be calm, enjoy life, seek inner happiness in life.
There is no alternative to books, one has to study, yet one’s bent of mind should be towards discovering new things.
Old friends are invaluable.
Childhood friends are precious, but selecting, making & maintaining new friendships is a task that requires immense prudence.
Keep learning something new, such as newer skills and languages.
Young people who leave their homes for the sake of studies should discover their new places, know more about the people, language, culture & tourism facets related to them.
My best wishes to all the young people about to begin a new innings.
Referring to the college season reminds me of someone I saw in the News recently… how Asharam Choudhury a student from an extremely poor family in Madhya Pradesh overcame life’s many challenges to achieve success.
In his maiden attempt, he cracked the Entrance exam for MBBS at AIIMS, Jodhpur.
His father earns his daily bread by waste-picking.
I congratulate him on his success.
There are many such instances of students from deprived families who, through sheer determination & perseverance overcame all odds and stood out to be beacons of inspiration to others.
I had made an appeal to change brain-drain into brain-gain.
Two IT Professionals from Rae Bareilly Yogesh Sahu ji and Rajneesh Bajpayee ji accepted my challenge and made a unique attempt.
With their joint efforts, Yogesh ji and Rajneesh ji have developed a SmartGaonApp by utilizing their professional skills.
This App is not only connecting the villagers with the whole world but now they can obtain any information on their own mobile phones.
Residents of the village Taudhakpur in Rae Bareilly, village chief, District Magistrate, CDO and every one joined in to create awareness amongst the masses.
This App contains phone directory, News section, events list, health centre and information centre of the village.
This seems to be the reason as to how he could develop this App which is most suited to needs of the village.
A sense of belonging towards the village and towards one’s roots and also a spirit to show and do something is naturally there in each and every Indian.
But, sometimes because of time, sometimes because of distance and at times because of situations that spirit gets faded but just with a touch of a tiny spark, everything re-emerges which takes one back to old memories.
We should also check if such a thing has happened in our case too whether circumstances, situations, distances have made us alien, whether dust has gathered over our determinations.
Our mother India is a land full of gems and treasures and the tradition of these great saints that adorned our land are at the same level as the great men who dedicated and sacrificed their lives for our Mother India.
One such great man has been Lok Manya Tilak who has left a very deep impression on the hearts of a large number of Indians.
We remember and pay our homage to Tilak ji on his birth anniversary on 23rd July and his death anniversary on 1st August.
Lokmanya Tilak was full of courage and self-confidence.
He had the courage to show a mirror to the British about their wrong doings.
The British were so afraid of Lok Manya Tilak that they tried to charge him of sedition thrice in two decades; this is no small thing.
I want to narrate an interesting incident to the countrymen which is connected with Lok Manya Tilak and his statue in Ahmedabad.
Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was elected the Mayor of Ahmedabad municipal corporation and he immediately selected Victoria Garden as a venue for Lok Manya Tilak’s memorial and this was the very Victoria Garden which was named after the British Queen.
The British were naturally not happy with this and the collector continually kept denying permission.
But Sardar Saheb was also Sardar Saheb after all, he was persistent and had remarked that he might have to give up on his post but Lok Manya Tilakji’s statue would certainly be built there.
Finally, the statue got built and Sardar Saheb got it unveiled by none other than Mahatma Gandhi on 28th February, 1929; and the most interesting point is that during that inaugural ceremony revered Bapuji said that with the coming of Sardar Patel, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has not only got a man but it has got the strength on the basis of which, building the statue of Tilakji has become possible.
This was the period when there was a need for people to get united in the fight against the British; these festivals, by breaking the barriers of casteism and communalism served the purpose of uniting all.
Such events gained more popularity with the passage of time.
Thus, it becomes clear that our younger generations still care for the brave heroes of our ancient past, its heritage and history.
Today, you can see Ganesh pandals in almost every street of various cities.
This is an excellent chance for our youth wherein they can learn qualities of leadership and organization and inculcate these in themselves.
I had requested last time too and now, while remembering Lokmanya Tilak, I will once again urge all of you to celebrate Ganesh Utsav with great enthusiasm and fervour whole heartedly but insist on keeping these celebrations eco-friendly.
Right from Ganesh idol to all decorative material everything ought to be eco friendly and I will appreciate that separate competitions be organized in each city, prizes be awarded for these; and I will like that eco friendly items related to Ganesh Utsav are displayed for wider publicity on My Gov and Narendra Modi App.
I will surely send your ideas and efforts to the people.
Lokmanya Tilak evoked self- confidence amongst our countrymen and gave the slogan “Swaraj is our birth right and I shall have it.”
Today is the time to say that Good Governance is our birth right and we will have it.
Every Indian should have access to good governance and positive results of development.
It is the factoring in of this outreach that will create a new India.
After 50 years of Tilak’s birth, on the same day i.e. on July 23, another son of Mother India was born, who sacrificed his life so that his countrymen could breathe freely in an atomsphere of freedom.
I am talking about none other than Chandrasekhar Azad.
Where will you find a young man in India who will not be inspired listening to these lines –
Once again, I bow and pay tributes to the two great sons of Bharat Mata – Lokmanya Tilakji and Chandrasekhar Azad ji.
Just a few days ago, in the Junior Under-20 World Athletics Championship in Finland, India’s brave daughter and a farmer daughter Hima Das made history by winning the gold medal in the 400-meter race event.
Ekta Bhyan, another daughter of the country, in response to my letter, has emailed me from Indonesia, where she is now preparing for the Asian Games.
Ekta has won the gold and bronze medals in World Para Athletics Grand Prix 2018 held in Tunisia.
Her achievement is all the more special because she has made the imposing challenges in her life the key to her success.
Daughter Ekta Bhyan in 2003, lost the use of half of her lower body due to road accident, but this daughter did not lose courage and made herself all the more stronger to perform this grand feat.
I salute Ekta Bhyanji, Yogesh Qathuniaji and Sundar Singh Ji, all of you for your fortitude and passion, and congratulate you!
May you go further than these successes, keep on playing and keep on blooming.
My dear countrymen, the month of August is significant because it is filled with historically important dates and festivals, but due to the weather sometimes sickness also enters the house.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has condoled the demise of Captain Jai Narain Prasad Nishad.
“Saddened by the demise of Captain Jai Narain Prasad Nishad Ji.
He served our nation with great diligence.
Captain Nishad’s efforts for the progress of Bihar were noteworthy.
His work towards empowering the poor will always be remembered.
The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi, will visit Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh tomorrow on 11 February 2019.
He will unveil the plaque to mark the serving of 3rd billionth meal by Akshaya Patra Foundation at Vrindavan Chandrodaya Mandir.
Shri Modi will also pay floral tribute at the Vigraha of Srila Prabhupad, the Acharya of ISCKON.
The occasion is to commemorate the serving of 3 billion meals by the foundation.
Akshaya Patra serves as an implementing partner of Mid-Day Meal Scheme.
In its 19-year journey, Akshaya Patra foundation has served mid-day meals to 1.76 million children in twelve states covering 14,702 schools.
In 2016, Akshaya Patra commemorated the serving of 2 billion cumulative meals in the presence of the then President of India, Pranab Mukherjee.
The Foundation works closely with the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) and State Governments to serve quality, hygienic, and nutritious food to millions of children.
Mid-Day Meal Scheme is considered to be the largest of its kind programme in the world.
PM mentioned about Akshaya Patra Foundation on October 24, 2018, during the launch of ‘Self4Society’ App in New Delhi.
Addressing the summit, Prime Minister said that India is on the move, in terms of its economy, infrastructure, youth and many other areas.
Following is the full text of PM’s address:
Distinguished Delegates from across the World,
Ladies and Gentlemen.
I welcome you all to the Global Mobility Summit.
We are the world’s fastest growing major economy.
Our cities and towns are on the Move.
We are building one hundred smart cities.
Our infrastructure is on the Move.
We are building roads, airports, rail lines and ports at a quick pace.
Our goods are on the Move.
The Goods and Services Tax has helped us rationalize supply chains and warehouse networks.
Our reforms are on the Move.
We have made India an easier place to do business.
Our lives are on the Move.
Families are getting homes, toilets, smoke-free LPG cylinders, bank accounts and loans.
Our youth are on the Move.
We are fast emerging as the start-up hub of the world.
India is moving ahead with new energy, urgency and purpose
We all know that, mobility has been key to the progress of humanity.
The world is now in the middle of a new mobility revolution.
It is already a major employer and can create the next generation of jobs.
Mobility is central to urbanization.
Motorized personal vehicles require ever-growing road, parking, and traffic infrastructure.
Mobility is a key element of ‘ease of living’.
Mobility is critical to preserving our planet.
Road transport accounts for one fifth of global Carbon dioxide emissions.
This threatens to choke cities and raise global temperatures.
Creating a mobility eco-system that is in sync with nature is the need of the hour.
Mobility is the next frontier in our fight against Climate Change.
Better mobility can provide for better jobs, smarter infrastructure, and improve the quality of life.
In India, we have been laying emphasis on mobility.
We have doubled our pace of construction of highways.
We have re-energized our rural road-building programme.
We are promoting fuel efficient and cleaner fuel vehicles.
We have developed low-cost air connectivity in under-served regions.
We are also starting operations on hundreds of new air routes.
We are pushing waterways in addition to traditional modes like rail and road.
We are reducing travel distances in our cities by efficient location of homes, schools and offices.
We have also started data-driven interventions such as intelligent traffic management systems.
However, we also need to encourage pedestrians and cycling by taking steps ensure their safety and priority.
In a rapidly transforming mobility paradigm, India has some inherent strengths and comparative advantages.
Our starting point is fresh.
We have little of the legacy of resource-blind mobility.
We have fewer vehicles per capita than other major economies.
Thus, we do not carry much of the baggage of other economies that were built on the back of private car ownership!
This gives us the window of opportunity to create an all-new, seamless mobility eco-system.
On the technology front, our strengths lie in information technology, big data, digital payments, and the internet-enabled shared economy.
These elements are increasingly becoming the drivers of the global future of mobility.
Our unique identity program, Aadhaar, and its India-stack eco-system, has laid down a comprehensive public digital infrastructure.
It has digitally empowered 850 million of our citizens.
India can demonstrate how such digital infrastructure can be combined with new mobility business models.
We also have a large, digitally literate, young population.
My vision for the future of mobility in India is based on 7 C’s – Common, Connected, Convenient, Congestion-free, Charged, Clean and Cutting-edge.

New business models driven by digitization, are re-inventing the current paradigm.
Big Data is enabling smarter decision-making by better understanding our patterns and needs.
Our focus must also go beyond cars, to other vehicles such as scooters and rickshaws.
The internet-enabled Connected Sharing Economy is emerging as the fulcrum of mobility.
This includes the elderly, the women and the specially abled.
We need to ensure that public transport is preferred to private modes of travel.

Hence, there should be emphasis on ending bottlenecks of networks.

We want to drive investments across the value chain from batteries to smart charging to Electric Vehicle manufacturing.
India’s business leaders and manufacturers are now poised to develop and deploy break-through battery technology.
The India Space Research Organization uses one of the best battery systems to run satellites in space.
Other institutions can partner with ISRO to develop cost effective and efficient battery systems for electric cars.
We want to build India as a driver in Electric Vehicles.
We will soon put in place a stable policy-regime around electric and other alternative fuel vehicles.
Policies will be designed as a win-win for all, and enable huge opportunities in the automotive sector.

This means a pollution-free clean drive, leading to clean air and better living standards for our people.
Electric Vehicles in particular can complement our investments in renewable energy.

It is Cutting-edge.
It is the next big innovation sector.
The ‘Move Hack’ and ‘Pitch to Move’ events organized over the past week show how young minds are coming up with creative solutions.
Entrepreneurs should see mobility as a sector with immense opportunity for innovation and growth.
It is a sector where innovation can help solve problems for public good.
I am convinced that the ‘Mobility Revolution’ is an enabler of our growth and development.
When India transforms mobility, it benefits one fifth of mankind.
It also becomes a scaled success story, for others to replicate.
Let us build a template, for the world to adopt.
In conclusion, let me particularly appeal to the youth of India.
My young, dynamic friends, this is your opportunity to lead a new era of innovation.
This is the future.
This is the sector that will absorb everything from those with doctors to engineers to drivers to mechanics.
We should embrace this revolution early, and leverage our strengths to lead the mobility innovation ecosystem both for ourselves and for others.
The Talent and Technology assembled here today, has the capability of making a transformative mobility shift for India and the World.
This shift will be based on ‘Caring for our World’, and ‘Sharing with Others’.
To quote from our ancient scriptures:
May we all be Protected.
May we all be Nourished
May we work together with great energy
May our intellect be Sharpened
I look forward to see what we can do together.
This summit is just the beginning.
Let us Move ahead.
Thank You Very Much!

This initiative seeks to empower the youth.
Another important collaboration between our two countries could be in the Gems and Jewelry sector.
Both countries could explore avenues for direct procurement of diamond.
Simplification of the existing visa regime for business-men and tourists, and direct connectivity would further ease business and people-to-people exchanges.

My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
There must be hardly any Indian who doesn’t feel proud of our Armed Forces, our army jawans, our soldiers.
Every Indian, irrespective of region, caste, religion, sect or language, is ever eager to express joy and show solidarity with our soldiers.
Yesterday, one hundred and twenty-five crore Indians celebrated the ParaakramParva, the festival of Valour.
We remembered that surgical strike carried out in 2016, where our soldiers gave a befitting reply to the audacity of a proxy war under the garb of terrorism.
At various places in the country, exhibitions have been organised by our Armed Forces in order to apprise the maximum number of citizens, especially the younger generation, of the might we possess; how capable we are and how our soldiers risk their lives to protect us citizens.
We staunchly believe in peace; we are committed to taking it forward… but NOT at the cost of compromising our self-respect and sovereignty of our Nation.
We have never eyed someone else’s territory maliciously.
This in itself was our commitment & dedication towards peace.
A few days ago, on the 23rd of September, on the occasion of the centenary of the Battle of Haifa in Israel, we remembered & paid tributes to our brave soldiers of Mysore, Hyderabad & Jodhpur Lancers who had freed Haifa from the clutches of oppressors.
This too was an act of valour on part of our soldiers on the path to peace.
Even today, India is one of the largest contributors to various United Nations Peace Keeping Forces in terms of sending forces personnel.
For decades, our brave soldiers wearing blue helmets have played a stellar role in ensuring maintenance of World Peace.
It has bestowed upon us a sense of security.
Women are already empowered and now getting armed too.
My dear countrymen, a few days ago, Officer AbhilashTomy of our Navy was struggling between life and death.
The whole country was concerned about saving Tomy.
You know, AbhilashTomy is a very courageous, brave soldier.
He was the first Indian who set on a global voyage in a small boat without any modern technology.
He fought to be afloat without food or drink.
He did not accept defeat and continued to fight death.
I pray for Tomy’s sound health and I am sure that his courage, bravery and resolve to fight and emerge a winner will inspire our younger generation.
My dear countrymen, every child in our country knows the importance of the 2nd of October for our nation.
The 2nd of October, this year, has a special significance.
For two years from now on, we are going to organise various programmes throughout the world on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhi’s philosophy has inspired the whole world.
Everyone including great personalities like Dr. Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela derived strength from Gandhiji’s ideology to be able to fight a long battle to ensure right of equality and dignity for the people.
Later, in 1945, when the Freedom Struggle gained momentum, he prepared an amended copy of those ideas.
Revered Bapu, put forth his ideas on various subjects like Farmers, villages, securing of labour rights, cleanliness and promoting of education.
This is also known as the Gandhi Charter.
Revered Babu was a people’s person.
Getting connected with people or connecting people with him was Bapu’s special quality, this was in his nature.
Everyone has experienced this as a most unique part of his personality.
He made everyone feel that he or she was very important and absolutely necessary for the country.
His biggest contribution in the Freedom struggle was that he made it an expansive “Jan-Aandolan” (People’s Movement).
During the Freedom Struggle people from all sections and all regions dedicated themselves at Mahatma Gandhi’s call.
Bapu gave an inspirational mantra to all of us which is known as Gandhiji’s Talisman.
In that, Gandhiji had said, “I give you one mantra, whenever you are in doubt or whenever your ego gets over your personality, undergo this test; remember the face of the poorest or the weakest person that you have seen, recall his looks and ask your inner self how useful your intended step would be for that person.
Will this, in anyway, benefit him!
Will he be able to get some control over his life and destiny through your step !
Meaning thereby that will your step help millions of those people in getting Swaraj who have an empty stomach and a dissatisfied soul!
Then, you will see that your doubt is waning away and your ego is also getting quelled.
My dear countrymen, one of Gandhiji’s mantras is very relevant event today.
The swelling middle class of the country, its increasing economic power, increasing purchasing power; can we remember revered Bapu for a moment while going out for shopping!
Can we remember that mantra of Bapu!”
Can we spare a thought while purchasing anything as to who in my country will be benefitted by this purchase!
Whose face will sport a smile!
Who will be the fortunate one to get a direct or indirect benefit from your purchase!
I will feel much happier if my purchase will benefit the poorest of the poor.
Keeping this mantra of Gandhiji in mind while making any purchases during the 150th Anniversary of Gandhiji, we must make it a point to see that our purchase must benefit one of our countrymen and in that too, one who has put in physical labour, who has invested money, who has applied skill must get some benefit.
This is the mantra of Gandhiji, this is the message of Gandhiji and I firmly believe that a small step of yours can surely bring about a very big benefit in the life of the poorest and the most underprivileged person.
My dear countrymen, when Gandhiji said that by maintaining cleanliness, freedom will be won then he probably was not aware how this would happen.
But this did happen and India got freedom.
For example, think of purchasing Khadi and handloom products on special occasions; this will benefit many weavers.
It is said that LalBahadurShastriji used to preserve old and worn out Khadi clothes because some one’s labour could be felt in the making of those clothes.
He used to say that all these Khadi clothes have been woven after putting in a hard labour, every thread of these clothes must be utilized.
This spirit of attachment towards the country and fellow countrymen was deeply imbibed in that great person of a very short physical stature.
Two days later, we shall celebrate the birth anniversary of Shastriji along with respected Bapu’s birth anniversary.
The very name of Shastriji evokes a feeling of eternal faith in the hearts of us, Indians.
His mild persona always fills every Indian with a sense of pride.
LalBahadurShastriji had a unique quality in that, he was very humble outwardly but he was rock solid from inside.
His slogan “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan” is the hall mark of his grand personality.
It was the result of his selfless service to the nation that in a brief tenure of about one and a half years he gave to our jawans and farmers the mantra to reach the pinnacle of success.
I went to the school, the foundation of which had been laid by none other than respected Baba Saheb himself.
On the 15th of September, people from all sections across the country connected themselves to this voluntary cleaning movement.
Institutions also extended their contribution enthusiastically.
School children, college students, NCC, NSS, youth organisations, media groups, the corporate world, all of them offered voluntary cleanliness service on a large scale.
I heartily congratulate all these cleanliness-loving countrymen for their efforts.
My dear countrymen, there is a Sanskrit quote- ‘न्यायमूलं स्वराज्यं स्यात्’(NyayamoolamSwarajyamSyat) meaning justice lies at the root of swaraj and while discussing the subject of justice, the spirit of human rights is inherent in that.
This is specially essential for the freedom and peace of the exploited, victimised and deprived people and to ensure justice for them.
In the Constitution drafted by Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar, many provisions were inserted to protect the fundamental rights of the poor.
Inspired by his vision, the ‘National Human Rights Commission’ (NHRC) was formed on 12th October 1993.
A few days later NHRC would complete 25 years of its existence.The NHRC has not only protected human rights but has also promoted respect for human dignity over the years.
For a healthy society, and for lofty democratic values I feel that, it is a very hope inspiring event.
Today, with NHRC operating at the national level, 26 State Human Rights Commissions have also been constituted.
As a society, we need to understand the importance of human rights and inculcate them into practice – this is the very basis of Sab kaSaath–Sab kaVikas’.

My Dear countrymen, Namaskar.
The year 2018 is about to conclude.
We shall soon enter 2019.
At such a juncture, it is natural to reflect on the year gone by; it is equally so, to hear about resolutions for the year being ushered in.
Electricity reached each & every village of the country this year.
Noted world institutions have accepted that the country has taken strides in the area of poverty alleviation at a record pace.
On account of the unwavering resolve of our countrymen, swachchata, sanitation coverage is rapidly advancing towards crossing the 95% mark.
After Independence, for the first time ever, the tricolor was hoisted at Red Fort on the 75th anniversary of the formation of the Azad Hind Government.
In honour of SardarVallabhbhai Patel who bonded the entire country around a common thread of unity, India witnessed the coming up of the tallest statue in the world, ‘Statue of Unity’.
The country secured a place of pride & glory in the entire world.
The highest United Nations Environment Award ‘Champions of the Earth’ was conferred upon India.
The world duly took notice of India’s efforts in the areas of Solar Energy & Climate Change.
The first General Assembly of the International Solar Alliance was held in India.
It is due to our collective efforts that our country has seen unprecedented improvement in the ‘Ease of doing business’ rankings.
The country’s self defence mechanism got further reinforced.
It was during this very year that our country has successfully accomplished the Nuclear Triad, which means we are now armed with nuclear capabilities-in water, on land and in the sky as well.
Daughters of the country have done her proud by circumnavigating the globe through the NavikaSagarParikrama.
India’s first inland waterway was launched in Varanasi.
This has laid the foundation of a new revolution in the waterways sector.
India scripted a thumping win in the under- 19 Cricket World Cup and the Blind Cricket World Cup.
This time, India clinched a large number of medals in the Asian Games.
India also performed very well in the Para Asian Games too.
By the way, if I continue enumerating examples of the Purusharth, the character & the mettle of Indians, or those of our collective endeavour, this episode of Mann Ki Baat will go on and on, perhaps to the point when 2019 makes an entry!
And all this has been possible due to the relentless efforts of a 130 crore countrymen.
I sincerely hope that India’s journey on the path of advancement & progress continues through 2019 too.
People fondly called him ‘MakkalMaaruthuvar’ since he had a special place in their hearts.
Dr. Jayachandran was known for his efforts of making the most economical treatment possible available to the poor.
People tell us that he would be ever ready & eager, when it came to treatment of patients.
In the case of elderly patients, he would even bear the cost of their travelling to and fro.
On the betterindia.com website, I have read about many of his endeavours that serve as an inspiration to society.
On similar lines, on the 25th of December, I learnt of the loss of SulagittiNarsamma in Karnataka.
SulagittiNarsamma was a midwife, aiding pregnant women during childbirth.
In Karnataka, especially in far-off, remote places, thousands of women availed of her services.
In the beginning of this year, she was honoured with a Padma Shri.
There are many exemplary personalities such as Dr. Jaya Chandran and SulagittiNarsamma, who dedicated their lives to the welfare of all in society.
Since we are referring to healthcare, I would like to mention the social endeavour of doctors in Bijnor, Uttar Pradesh.
Recently, I was told by some of our party workers that a few young doctors in the town set up camps offering free treatment for the underprivileged.
Every month, the Heart Lungs Critical Centre there organizes such camps, where free diagnosis and treatment for a host of ailments is done.
Every month, hundreds of poor patients are benefitting from these camps.
The dedication of these doctor friends engaged in selfless service is truly worthy of praise.
Today, I’m saying it with pride that it was collective efforts that made the ‘Swachch Bharat Mission’ a successful campaign.
I was told that a few days ago, in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, over three lakh people came together to work for the sanitation campaign.
In this ‘Mahayagya’, grand undertaking, the Municipal Corporation, voluntary bodies, School- College students, the people of Jabalpur; in fact everyone participated with enthusiasm & Zest.
I am glad to observe that these days, there are many websites apprising us of inspiring life- stories of such remarkable gems.
Just as thepoitiveindia.com is doing great work in spreading positivity and infusing more sensitivity into society.
Similarly, success stories of young innovators & entrepreneurs are women beautifully on yourstory.com.
In the same way, you can easily learn the Sanskrit language sitting at home through samskritabharati.in.
Can we join hands in one endeavour?..
Sports has its own significance in every society.
When a game is being played, the spectators too experience a rush of energy in their beings.
We observe name, fame and laurels when it comes to sportspersons.
But, at times, in the background, there exist many things that are much higher, much greater than the world of sports.
Let me tell you about one of our daughters from Kashmir who won a gold medal in a Karate Championship in Korea.
On behalf of all countrymen, I wish her a bright future.
Best wishes and blessings to Hanaya.
Similarly, the media discussed extensively about the 16 year old Rajani.
You too must have read it.
Early every morning, Jasmer Singh used to leave for work before Rajani and her siblings woke up.
When Rajani approached her father, expressing her wish to learn boxing, he encouraged her, arranging for whatever possible resources that he could.
Rajani had to start her training in boxing with old gloves, since those days, the family was not too well, financially.
Despite so many hurdles, Rajani did not lose heart & went ahead with her training in boxing.
She has won a medal in Serbia too.
My best wishes and blessings to Rajani.
I also congratulate her parents Jasmer Singh ji and Usha Rani Ji for supporting & encouraging Rajani.
This very month, 20 year old Vedangi Kulkarni from Pune became the fastest Asian to traverse the globe riding a bicycle.
She rode for 159 days, covering around 300 kilometres every day.
Just imagine… 300 kms of cycling every day !
Her passion for cycling is indeed commendable.
Don’t news of such achievements, such accomplishments inspire us?
Especially my young friends, when we hear about such feats, we derive inspiration to touch heights despite obstacles.
If your resolve is strong, if your fervor, your enthusiasm is without bounds, all your hurdles halt in their tracks.
Hardships can never turn into obstacles.
When we come to know of such examples, we too feel inspired every moment of our life.
We can witness how closely our festivals are interlinked with nature.
This traditional calendar depicts our bonding with natural and astronomical events.
The lunar and solar Calendars based on the movement of earth with respect to moon and sun decide the occurrence and dates of our festivals.
It is also dependant on the fact which calendar you follow.
In many regions the position of the planetary constellations determines the occurrence and celebration of festivals.
GudiPadva, Chettichand, Ugadi and others are all celebrated according to the lunar Calendar, whereas Tamil PutanduVishnu, Baisakh, Baisakhi, PoilaBoisakh, Bihu are all celebrated in accordance with solar calendar.
The sagacity of conserving rivers and water is inherently reflected in many of our festivals.
Chhath festival is associated with the worship of the sun, rivers and ponds.
I wish all of you a great year 2019 and do hope that you all to enjoy the oncoming festive season.
Doo share the photographs taken on these festivals with one another so that everyone can witness the diversity of India and the beauty of Indian culture.
People from all over the country and around the world come and participate in the Kumbh.
In the Kumbh Mela, there is a tidal upsurge of faith and reverence.
Millions and millions of people from India and around the world congregate at one place.
The tradition of Kumbh has bloomed and flourished as part of our great cultural heritage.
This time the world famous Kumbh Mela is going to be held in Prayagraj from January 15, and many of you might be waiting eagerly for it to take place.
The process of Sant- Mahatmas converging at the Kumbh Mela has already started.
It is a measure of its global importance that last year UNESCO has marked Kumbh Mela in the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
A few days ago the Ambassadors of many countries witnessed for themselves the preparations for Kumbh.
The national flags of many countries were together hoisted at the Kumbh.
If during the course of this event sanitation prevails along with reverence, then it will lead to a positive message reaching far and wide.
This time every devotee will be able to have a darshan of the pious Akshayavat after the holy dip in the confluence.
This great symbol of people’s faith was locked up in the fort for hundreds of years, due to which the devotees despite a deep seated desire could not get a glimpse of.
Now the entrance gate of Akshayavat have been opened for everyone.
I urge all of you to share different aspects of Kumbh and photos on social media when you go to Kumbh so that more and more people feel inspired to go to Kumbh.
May this Kumbh of Spirituality become Mahakumbh of Indian Philosophy.
May this Kumbh of faith also become Mahakumbh of ofnationalism.
And a Mahakumbh of National integration
May this Kumbh of the devotees also become Mahakumbh of global tourists.
We are fortunate that South African President Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa is going to grace the Republic Day celebrations as chief guest.
Our revered Bapu and South Africa shared an unbreakable bond.
It was South Africa, where Mohan transformed into the ‘Mahatma’.
We all know that Nelson Mandela was the role model of struggle against racism all over the world and who was the inspiration for Mandela?
He derivedinspiration and endurancefor spending many years in jail from Bapu himself.
Both Bapu and Mandela are not only sources of inspiration for the entire world, but their ideals have always encouraged us to create a society full of love and compassion.
What kind of steps should be taken to strengthen the security of the country and that of the countrymen, was discussed in detail.
At the same conference, I also announced the awarding of ‘Sardar Patel Award’ for National Integration to be given to those who have contributed for national unity in any form.
Sardar Patel dedicated his entire life for the unity of the country.
He always remained engaged in keeping India’s integrity intact.
SardarSaheb believed that the power of India lay in the diversity of the land.
It is our way of paying homage to Sardar Patel’s aspirations through this award for National Integration.
Guru Gobind Singh Ji was born in Patna.
His birthplace was Patna, Karmabhoomi was north India and the last moments were spent in Nanded.
In a way, entire India received his blessings.
A glimpse of his life span reflects a glimpse of the entire India.
After the martyrdom of his father Shri Guru TeghBahadurji, Guru Gobind Singh Ji attained the hallowed position of the Guru at a tender ageof nine years.
Guru Gobind Singh ji had inherited courage to fight for justice from the legacy of Sikh Gurus.
I can make the sparrow fight against the hawk
That be the reason that Gobindsingh be my name.”
He used to preach that strength cannot be demonstrated by fighting against the weaker sections.
Shri Gobind Singh Ji believed that the biggest service is to alleviate human suffering.
He was an archer, and a pundit of Gurmukhi, BrajBhasha, Sanskrit, Persian, Hindi and Urdu and many other languages.
I once again bow paying my obeisance to Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji.
Such a unique effort is being attempted by F.S.S.A.I viz Food Safety and Standard Authority of India.
Under the aegis of “Eat Right India” campaign, ‘Swasth Bharat’ trips are being carried out across the country.
These campaigns will last till Jan 27th.
At times, government organizations are tagged as a regulator, but it is commendable that F.SA.A.I has been working beyond this brief for public awareness and public education.
A clean and healthy India will spell a prosperous India also.
Nutritious food is most essential for good health.
In this context, I extend hearty greetings to F.S.S.A.I for this initiative.
I urge you to the utmost, let’s join this initiative.
You should participate in this initiative and especially I urge you to make you children witness these campaigns.

We hope that they will soon be able to meet with their families in Myanmar.
My time in Nay Pyi Taw was very meaningful.
I am also very excited about my remaining stay in Myanmar.
Today I will go to the Anand Temple in the Bagan.
Apart from meeting the community of Indian origin people in Yangon, I will also pay my tributes at the monuments of religious and historical importance.
It will facilitate sharing of experience and expertise of both the parties in the area of recruitment.
The MoU will develop institutionalized linkage between the Public Service Commissions of two countries.
It defines the scope of cooperation between the PSC, Mauritius and the UPSC and sets out the areas of cooperation and obligations of the Parties.
The areas of co-operation include the following-
In the past, UPSC had signed MoU with Public Service Commission of Canada and Bhutan.
The MoU with Canada was in existence during 15.03.2011 to 14.03.2014.
In pursuance of these MoUs, UPSC had conducted attachments and training programmes for the officers of RCSC, Bhutan.
Today, the country is brimming with self-confidence.
The country is scaling new heights by working extremely hard, with a resolve to realize its dreams.
Today’s dawn has brought a new spirit, a new enthusiasm, a new zeal and a new energy with it.
My dear countrymen, in our country, there is a Neelakurinji flower which blooms once every 12 years.
This year, Neelakurinji is in full bloom on the hills of Southern Nilgiri like the Ashok Chakra (the wheel of Ashoka) in the Tricolour on our Independence Day.
Displaying utmost sensitivity and alertness, our Parliament has made the social justice framework stronger to protect the interests of the weaker sections of society – be it a Dalit, a deprived or exploited person or women.
The demand to confer constitutional status on the OBC Commission had existed for years.
My dear countrymen,
The next year will mark 100 years of the Jallianwallah Bagh massacre.
Our masses had sacrificed their lives for the country’s freedom at a time when atrocities had crossed all limits.
The Jallianwallah Bagh incident reminds us of the sacrifices made by the brave hearts and is an inspiration to us.
I salute all the brave people from the depths of my heart.
My dear countrymen,
Our freedom has come at a price.
Under the leadership of Bapu and the revolutionaries, many heroes, many satyagrahis, brave men and women and youth participated in the freedom struggle of the country.
My dear countrymen,
After Independence, in order to realize the dreams of such great personalities, to meet the aspirations of freedom fighters and to fulfill the hopes and expectations of the citizens of the country, India drafted an inclusive Constitution under the leadership of respected Baba Saheb Ambedkar ji.
This inclusive Constitution is the harbinger of a resolve to build a New India.
Dear brothers and sisters,
The Constitution also guides us to draw inspiration from our Tricolor.
Be it our elderly, differently-abled, our women, marginalized or deprived people, or our Adivasi brethren living in the forests, everyone must get an opportunity to grow, as per their hopes and aspirations.
When 125 crore countrymen become partners, then each and every citizen joins us in the progress of the country.
They have come together, were together and will continue to be together.
I feel that this synergy of 125 crore active citizens from more than 6 lakhs villages is the real strength of our nation.
If we don’t look at from where we began our journey, it will not be possible to assess how far we have come.
We will strive to maintain the same pace of development.
Our soldiers reach out to provide relief and rescue operations during natural calamities.
Take for instance the case of MSP – economists, farmer organizations, farmers as well as political parties had been demanding, that farmers should get an MSP which is one and a half times of their investment.
We took a bold decision of giving the farmers the MSP which is one and half times their investment.
Today, with the help of small traders, their open mindedness and their attitude of accepting the new, the country has implemented GST.
A new found confidence has been generated in the business community.
The Jawans of our defence forces were demanding one-rank one-pension for several decades.
You gave us the responsibility of taking this decision and we fulfilled it positively.
My dear brothers and sisters,
We are not the kind of people who work in the interest of the party.
 
This follows from a series of time bound policy decisions.
 
 
My dear brothers and sisters,
My dear countrymen, if an Indian is in trouble or distress in any part of the world, he can rest assured that his country is with him at every step.
However, today my dear brothers and sisters, North-East is coming up with positive and inspiring stories.
North-East today is shining in the field of sports.
My dear brothers and sisters, today we are receiving news from North-East that the last village has been electrified and the entire village danced the whole night.
We are hearing more such news from the North East about highways, railways, airways, waterways and information ways (i-ways) coming to the region.
The work of installing electric transmission lines across the North-East is progressing at a rapid pace.
Today youth from the North-East are establishing BPOs in the region.
North-East is going to host the Sports University.
Within four years, we have brought Delhi to the doorsteps of North-East.
Brothers and sisters, today, about 65% of the population in the country is below 35 years of age.
We are proud of our country’s youth.
Our country’s youngsters have completely transformed the meaning of all standards of the economy.
They have infused new colours to the country’s standard of progress.
There was a time when only big cities used to hog all the limelight.
Today, our country is talking about Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities and paying attention to the youngsters engaged in modern agriculture in the rural areas.
The youth of our country has completely transformed the nature of jobs.
This in itself is a great example of the changing ecosystem.
Some people have doubts, which is quite natural, but we are determined.
So in order to realize this promise by 75th year of Independence, we want to move along with the farmers in that direction by bringing modernity and diversity in agricultural sector.
We want to bring value addition right from seeds to marketing.
Khadi is associated with the name of respected Bapu.
I want to humbly submit that the sale of khadi products since independence has doubled.
This has generated employment for the poor.
My brothers and sisters, the farmers of my country are emphasizing on solar farming now.
Apart from farming, they can earn money by selling power generated through solar farming.
Without human dignity, no country can move forward in a balanced way.
So to protect human dignity, we have to move ahead with those schemes which will ensure respectable lives for people.
The policies, traditions and intentions should be such that ordinary people, including the poorest of the poor can get a chance to live with equal dignity.
So we have provided gas connection to the poor through Ujjawala Yojana.
We have provided electricity to the poor through Saubhagya Yojana.
We are emphasizing on moving ahead with the concept of ‘Shrameva Jayate’.
Only yesterday, we heard the President’s address to the nation.
He described in great detail the Gram Swaraj Abhiyan.
Whenever, there is talk about Government, it is said that policies are framed but there is no last mile delivery.
The President described well how this campaign that was launched in Delhi has now spread to 65000 villages in aspirational districts, to the huts of the poor; how it is working in the backward villages.
My dear countrymen, when I talked about cleanliness from the Ramparts of Red Fort in 2014, some people made fun.
Some of them even said the Government had many things to do, why is it wasting its energy on an issue like cleanliness.
But my dear brothers and sisters, in a recent report the WHO has said that because of the cleanliness campaign three lakh children were saved.
The credit for saving lives of three lakh children goes to every Indian who was a part of this campaign.
My Brothers and Sisters, it is true that because of cleanliness, lives of three lakh children have been saved.
But no matter how happy a middle class family is and how well-to-do it is or how poor it is, once a family member falls sick, the whole family suffers.
On occasions generations are afflicted with illnesses.
New hospitals will be built in the tier-2 and tier-3 cities.
They will require medical staff in large numbers.
According to the report, five crore poor people in India have crossed the Poverty Line in the last two years.
Our country works for the pride and honour of the poor people, but what do these middlemen do?

Similarly, rice which is sold at Rs.30-32 in the market is purchased by the Government at this rate and provided to the poor at Rs.3 on ration cards.
This means if anyone steals 1 kg of wheat on a bogus ration card, he automatically gains Rs.20-25.
I want to touch the hearts of the honest taxpayers.
I want to reassure the honest taxpayers that all the schemes that are in operation are run by your money.
This is the most virtuous task for a person.
Till 2013, i.e. for the last 70 years, there were 4 crore people who were paying direct taxes.
I salute all those who are embracing transparency and honesty.
I wish to reassure those who want to step forward.
You are making a contribution in the nation’s progress.
Dear countrymen, times have changed.
Dear countrymen, we have rooted out nepotism and affiliations.
We have strongly condemned favoritism and bias.
Strong action is being taken against corrupt officers.
More than three lakh dubious companies have been closed down, and restrictions have been imposed on their directors.
We sometimes see demonic forces posing challenges to women’s power.
Rape is painful, and we, the countrymen, the people should feel many times more pain than the pain borne by the victim.
Brothers and sisters, we have to free this society from this demonic mentality.
The law is taking its own course.
Recently, rapists in a case from Katni in Madhya Pradesh were sentenced to death after just five days of trial.
Similarly, in Rajasthan, rapists were sentenced to death after a few days of trial.
More such news gets published, the more such people with demonic mentality will get scared.
We have to publicize such news.
The work of building IIT, IIM and AIIMS is speedily going on.
The work of reclamation of Dal Lake is also going on.
The biggest thing is that during the past one year village headmen from Jammu and Kashmir in large numbers have been meeting me with the request to hold Panchayat elections there.
The elections could not be held for some reason or the other.
I am happy that the villagers of Jammu and Kashmir will have this opportunity in the coming months.
A system in which villagers will be able to look after their villages will be in place soon.
Now, the Government of India gives huge funds which go directly to the villages and this will help the village headmen to take their villages on the path of development.
That is why we are moving forward in the direction of holding Panchayat elections and election to City Councils.
And that is why we are going ahead with this aim and today standing under this tricolour, once again I want to reiterate the resolve for which we are ready to sacrifice ourselves.
Let every Indian have a house of his own – Housing for All.
Every house should have electricity connection, power for all.
I am impatient for my country to lead it.
My dear countrymen, we want to move ahead.
We cannot accept stagnation, we cannot be standstill and it is not in our nature to bend before anybody.
And that legacy is due to our self-confidence, and we want to carry forward the legacy.
My dear countrymen, we don’t want to only dream about the future, but aspire to scale new heights in the future.
We want to move forward with the dream of being at the top.

I believe that all the members of the House will move ahead with this spirit.

I am visiting the Republic of Korea at the invitation of President Moon Jae-in.
My visit to the Republic of Korea is reflective of the importance we both attach to our relationship.
We regard the Republic of Korea as a valued friend, a nation with which we have a Special Strategic Partnership.
As fellow democracies, India and the ROK have shared values and a shared vision for regional and global peace.
As fellow market economies, our needs and strengths are complementary.
ROK is an important partner for our ‘Make in India’ initiative as well as in our ‘Start Up India’ and ‘Clean India’ initiatives.
Our collaboration in the field of science and technology is encouraging, with our joint research ranging from basic to advanced sciences.
Our people to people ties and exchanges, as always, provide the bedrock of our ties of friendship.
We were touched by President Moon’s decision to send the First Lady as his special representative at the ‘Deepotsav’ Festival held in Ayodhya last November.
The growing depth and variety in our relationship has been accentuated by the harmony between our Act East Policy and ROK’s New Southern Policy.
Working together, we are determined to take our relationship forward as a ‘future oriented partnership for People, Prosperity and Peace’.
During this visit, apart from my discussions with President Moon, I will meet with business leaders, members of the Indian community as well as eminent persons from all walks of life.

India remembers our brave soldiers who fought in WW-1.
This was a war in which India was not directly involved yet our soldiers fought world over, just for the cause of peace.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
I urge you to participate in the largest possible numbers in this run for unity.
Such was his sense of honesty & commitment that the farmer, the worker right up to the industrialist trusted him with full faith.
Gandhiji considered Sardar Patel as the only one capable of finding a lasting solution to the vexed issue of the states and asked him to act.
Sardar Patel formulated solutions one by one, weaving the warp & weft of unity on the axis of a single thread.
He ensured the merger of all princely states with the Dominion of India.
It is but natural for us to solemnly remember SardarVallabhbhai Patel as we exalt the spirit of unity that binds our Nation, our Mother India.
Erected on the banks of river Narmada in Gujarat, the structure is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty.
This is the world’s tallest scyscraping statue.
Every Indian will now be proud to see the world’s tallest statue here on Indian soil.
Sardar Patel, a true son of the soil will adorn our skies too.
I hope every Indian being will swell with pride on this remarkable feat of mother India… and will sing paeans of glory in its praise with the head held high.
My dear brothers & sisters, we celebrated ‘Infantry Day’ yesterday.
I respectfully bow before all of them who are part of the Indian Armed Forces.
This is the very day when Indian Forces landed in Kashmir and saved the valley from the clutches of aggression.
This incident too is directly related to SardarVallabhbhai Patel.
Around this time, military operations commenced in Kashmir.
Our respectful tributes to Indira ji too.
My dear countrymen, who doesn’t love sports?
If the youth of a country possess these qualities, that country will progress not only in areas such as Economy and Science & Technology but also bring laurels home in the field of sports.
Just recently I had two memorable meetings.
These athletes bagged a tally of 72 medals, creating a new, unprecedented record, bringing glory to the nation.
Similarly, I was blessed with a chance to meet our winners of the Summer youth Olympics 2018 held in Argentina.
You will be pleased to know that in the Summer Youth Olympics 2018, the performance of our youth was the best ever.
At this event we won 13 medals besides 3 in mixed events.
You may recall that even, in the recent Asian Games, India’s performance was par excellence.
Have you observed the way I have frequently used terms such as ‘the best ever’ or ‘new, unprecedented record’?
This is the real story of Indian Sports which are witnessing an upswing with each passing day.
India is setting new records not just in the field of sports but also in hitherto uncharted areas.
To give you an example, I would like to mention about Para Athlete Narayan Thakur, who won a gold medal for the country in the 2018 Para Asian Games.
He is a Divyang by birth.
When he turned eight he lost his father.
Then he spent another eight years in an orphanage.
After leaving the orphanage, he eked out a living cleaning DTC buses and working as waiter at roadside eateries.
The same Narayan is winning medals for India at International events.
More than 12 lakh enthusiasts enjoyed the romance of Football matches in various stadia across the country and boosted the morale of the young players.
This year also, we have been fortunate to be the hosts of the Men’s Hockey World Cup 2018 in Bhubaneshwar.
The Hockey World Cup will commence on the 28th November to be concluded on the 16th December.
Each Indian who plays any game or has interest in any game has a definite interest in Hockey.
India has produced many great hockey players.
Wheneverthere will be reference to Hockey,the story will remain incomplete without a mention of these legends.
Hockey maestro Major Dhyan Chand is a renowned name all over the world.
Then, from Balbeer Singh Senior, Leslie Claudius, Mohammad Shahid, Udham Singh to Dhan Raj Pillai, Indian Hockey has had a very long journey.
Even today, players of Team India are encouraging the younger generation through their hard work and focused attention.
It is a good chance for the sport lovers to witness closely contested matches.
Go to Bhubaneshwar and cheer up the Indian team and also encourage each team there.
Odisha has a dignified historical background and has a very rich cultural tradition.
People of the state are full of warmth.
This is a chance for the sports lovers to see Odisha.
They can visit the world famous holy places like the Sun Temple of Konark, Lord Jagannath Temple in Puri and Chilka Lake along with enjoying the games there.
I convey my best wishes to our Men’s Hockey Team for this tournament and assure them that 125 crore Indians are supporting them.
I also convey my wishes to all the teams from around the world coming to participate in the tournament.
My dear countrymen, the way people are coming forward and volunteering for social works is really inspirational and encouraging for all our countrymen.
Their dedication and vigour can make each Indian feel proud.
A fresh and pleasant air of IT to society, We-not I, a transformation from the individual to the community is imbibed in this.
Someone is teaching the old people; someone is involved in the campaign of cleanliness whereas someone is helping out the farmers.
This spirit, this dedication is a mission mode activity.
Will this not make every Indian feel proud.
My dear brothers and sisters, when I was going through your suggestion for Mann Ki Baat this time, I found a very interesting comment from Shri Manish Mahapatra from Pudducherry.
He wrote on Mygov- Please take up the topic “in Mann Ki Baat” as to how the tribes and their traditions and rituals are the best examples of coexistence with the nature.
Congratulations to bhaiGurbachan Singh ji !
Congratulations to the people of KallarMajra and of all those places who are making their best efforts to keep the environment clean and pollution free.
All of you are carrying forward the Indian tradition of a healthy life style as a true successor.
Just as a sea is formed by collection of tiny drops, similarly,a small constructive step, plays a vital role in creating a positive environment.
My dear countrymen, it has been told in our epics:-
Wherever there will be a talk of world peace, India’s name and contribution will be written in golden letters.
For India, World War I was an important event.
Rightly speaking we had no direct connection with that war.
This made the whole world realize and understand the importance of peace.
The definition of peace has changed in the last hundred years.
Today, peace does not only mean ‘no war’.
There is a need to work unitedly to address issues such as terrorism, climate change, economic development to social justice through universal cooperation and co-ordination.
Development of the poorest of the poor is the real indicator of peace.
My dear countrymen, our North-East has a unique distinction of its own.
Now our North-east is also known for all best deeds.
North east is one region that has made grand progress in organic farming.
A few days ago Sikkim won the prestigious Future Policy Gold Award, 2018 for encouraging the sustainable food system.
This award is given by the UN body ‘Food & Agriculture Organisation’ – FAO.
You will be delighted to know that this best policy making award is equivalent to an Oscar in the sector.
Not only this, our Sikkim outperformed 51 nominated policies of 25 countries to win this award.
For this, I heartily compliment the people of Sikkim.
My dear countrymen, October is about to end.
Quite a change is being felt in the weather.
I extend my best wishes to all countrymen for these festivals.
I would request all of you to take best care of yourselves and take care of your health as well and also take care of social interests.
I am sure these festivals are an opportunity to make new resolves.
The objectives of the MoU are, exchange of information on resources, laws and policy, organization of seminars to exchange views on development strategies, encouragement of transfer of technologies between the Parties, promotion of value addition and opportunities for investment in the mining sector.
 
Minister for Commerce & Industry, Government of India;
President and CEO of the Chosun-ilboGroup;
Business Leaders of Korea and India;
I am very happy to be here with you.
Such a large gathering of Korean companies in India is actually a global story.
I take this opportunity to welcome all of you to India.
The relationship between India and Korea dates back centuries.
It is believed that an Indian Princess travelled to Korea and became a queen in Korea.
We are also bound by our Buddhist traditions.
Our Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore composed a poem – ‘Lamp of the East’ – in 1929 about Korea’s glorious past and its bright future.
It is also a good co-incidence that India and South Korea both celebrate their Independence Day on the 15th of August.
From Princess to poetry and from Buddha to Bollywood; we have so much in common.
As I have mentioned earlier, I have always been fascinated by Korea.
I visited Korea when I was Chief Minister of Gujarat.
I used to wonder how a country of the size of Gujarat can make such economic progress.
I admire the spirit of enterprise of the Korean people.
I admire the way in which they have created and sustained their global brands.
From IT and Electronics to Automobile and Steel, Korea has given exemplary products to the world.
Korean companies are appreciated for their innovation, and strong manufacturing capability.
It is heartening to note that our bilateral trade crossed 20 billion dollars last year, for the first time in six years.
My visit in 2015 led to a positive focus on India.
India offers a lot of potential for the Korean Investors with its huge market and enabling policy environment.
Since many of you are already present in India, you already know the ground realities.
I would like to use this occasion to personally invite to India those who are not yet present here.
In India, we have all the three together.
By Democracy, I mean the system based on liberal values which ensures free and fair play towards one and all.
By Demography, I mean a vast and talented pool of young and energetic workforce.
By Demand, I mean a big and growing market for goods and services.
A rising middle class is creating further growth in the domestic market.
We have worked towards creating a stable business environment, ensuring the rule of law, and removing arbitrariness in decision making.
We seek positivity in day to day transactions.
We are widening the areas of trust; rather than digging into doubts.
This represents a complete change of the Government’s mindset.
A shift from issuing authority to business partner to achieve ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance’.
And when this happens, simplification of rules and procedures starts automatically.
We are on a de-regulation and de-licensing drive.
Nearly 65 percent to 70 percent of the items previously under licensing can now be produced without a license.
We have said that factory inspections will only be need-based and only on authorization of the higher authority.
In Dime are one of the most open countries now.
Most of the sectors of our economy are open for FDI.
More than 90 percent approvals have been put on automatic route.
There is practically no requirement of Government approval for investments in manufacturing sector except for Defense sector.
Incorporating a company along with allotment of statutory numbers is now just a one day affair.
We have carried out thousands of reforms on the business, investment, governance and cross border trading front.
Some of them like GST are historic.
Many of you might already be experiencing the ease in operations due to GST.
We have entirely abolished more than1400 old laws and Acts which were only complicating governance such measures have propelled our economy into a high growth trajectory.
FDI inflows have grown the most in the last three years.
There is a new energy and vibrancy in the domestic industry.
A new start up eco-system has been un-veiled.
With unique ID and mobile phone penetration, we are fast moving towards becoming a Digital Economy.
We moved up 19 places on the Logistics Performance Index of 2016 of World Bank.
We have improved 31 places in last two years in the Global Competitiveness Index of the World Economic Forum.
We have also moved up twenty one places on the Global Innovation Index of WIPO in two years.
We are among the top 10 FDI destinations listed by UNCTAD.
Ours is a globally cost competitive manufacturing eco-system.
We have a vast pool of skilled professionals with knowledge and energy.
Now, we have a world class engineering education base and strong R&D facilities.
An informal economy into a formal economy, you can imagine the range and span of our work.
We are already the third-largest economy by purchasing power.
Very soon, we will become the world’s fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP.
We are also the fastest growing major economy of the world today.
We are also a country with the one of the largest Start up eco-systems.
This initiative has been well supplemented by programmers like ‘Digital India’ and ‘Skill India’.
Cleaner and greener development and Zero defect Zero effect manufacturing is another commitment.
We have committed to the world and are moving aggressively for adoption of better environmental technologies.
I have said earlier that there is huge potential for cooperation between India’s software and Korea’s IT industry.
Your car making and our designing capabilities can be put together.
Though we have become the third biggest producer of steel, we need to add lot of value in it.
Your steel-making capacity and our resources of iron ore can be put together for better products.
Similarly, your ship-building capacity and our agenda of port led development can become a driver of our partnership.
Housing, smart cities, railway stations, water, transportation, railways, sea ports, energy including renewables, IT infrastructure and services, electronics, are all very promising sectors in my country.
India and Korea are major economies in the region.
Our partnership has immense potential to promote regional growth, development, stability and prosperity in Asia.
Both stand to gain by deepening their partnership.
India a huge and emerging market.
It can also be a bridge for Korean business to penetrate the Middle East and African markets.
You may recollect that the need for a hand-holding agency was felt during my visit to Korea.
It was announced that a dedicated team would be established for Korean Investments in India.
Accordingly, “Korea Plus” was formed in June 2016.
The mandate of Korea Plus is to promote, facilitate and retain Korean investments in India.
It is envisaged as the first reference point for Korean Investors in India.
Korea Plus has facilitated more than 100 Korean Investors in a short span of about two years.
It acts as a partner throughout the investment cycle of Korean companies.
This shows our commitment towards welcoming Korean people and companies; ideas and investments.
I would like to conclude by saying that India is now ready for business.
India is now a free destination for enterprise.
You will not find such a free and growing market anywhere in the world.
At a personal level too, I assure you of my full support whenever required.

Among the projects inaugurated are the Varanasi City Gas Distribution Project, and the Varanasi-Ballia MEMU train.
The foundation stone was laid for the PanchkoshiParikrama Marg, and several projects under the Smart City Mission and NamaamiGange.

The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has greeted Indian Navy personnel and their families on Navy Day.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
A few days ago, I got an opportunity to accompany the Prime Minister of Israel to Ahmedabad, Gujarat for the inauguration of ‘I create’.
They have issued guidelines; simultaneously they keep imparting training on a regular basis for capacity building.
In Districts prone to floods and cyclones, an initiative names ‘Aapada Mitra’ has been launched for training Volunteers.
Training and awareness have a very important role to play.
Two- three years ago, thousands of people would lose their lives every year due to heat-wave.
After that, NDMA organized workshops on heat wave management as part of a campaign to raise awareness in people.
Mass participation led to good results.
In 2017, the death toll on account of heat wave remarkably came down to around 220 or so.
This proves that if we accord priority to safety, we can actually attain safety.
I laud the role played by innumerable individuals, citizens who immediately embark upon rescue and relief operations wherever a disaster strikes.
And there are numerous such unnamed, unsung heroes.
Our Fire & Rescue services, National Disaster Response Forces Armed Forces, Paramilitary Forces… these brave hearts go beyond the call of duty to help people in distress, often risking their own lives.
Organisations like NCC and Scouts are also contributing in this task; they are getting trained too.
We’ll have to make it part of our life, our being.
In day to day life, during air travel, we must have frequently come across air hostesses giving out a rather longish speech, safety instructions at the beginning of a flight.
Was there a scope of direct visibility when the information was given?
Of course there was.
We experience this in all walks of life.
My dear countrymen, in the current budget, emphasis has been laid on turning ‘waste to wealth’ and ‘waste to energy’ through Bio gas, under the Swachch Bharat Campaign.
An effort was initiated which was named GOBAR-Dhan – Galvanizing Organic Bio Agro Resources.
The aim of this GOBAR- DHAN scheme is ensuring cleanliness in villages and generating wealth and energy by converting cattle dung and solid agricultural waste into Compost and Bio Gas.
A target has been set to use cattle dung, agricultural waste, kitchen waste to produce Bio gas based energy.
Under the Gobardhan Scheme our farmer brothers & sisters in rural India will be encouraged to consider dung and other waste not just as a waste but as a source of income.
Biogas generation will increase self-reliance in energy utilized for cooking and lighting.
Farmers and cattle herders will be helped in augmenting their income.
There will be novel opportunities for newer jobs linked to waste collection, transportation, biogas sales etc.
An online trading platform will be created for better implementation of ‘Gobar Dhan Yojana’, it will connect farmers to buyers so that farmers can get the right price for dung and agricultural waste.
I urge entrepreneurs, especially our sisters residing in rural India, to step forward, and through creation of self-help groups and cooperative societies extract full advantage from this opportunity.
My dear countrymen, till date, we have been hearing about the myriad types of festivals – be it music festivals, food festivals, film festivals and many other kinds of festivals.
But in a unique endeavor in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, the state’s first ‘Trash Mahotsav’ was organized.
A plethora of activities were organized during this festival, which found full participation of students and adults.
Different types of artifacts were made utilizing garbage.
Many Workshops were organized to inform people on the entire aspects of waste management.
Raipur inspired various types of such garbage or trash festivals in other districts too.
Many individuals taking initiative on their own behalf shared innovative ideas, held discussions, conducted poetry recitals.
A festive atmosphere regarding cleanliness got geared up.
The way the school children took part in the entire endeavor was amazing.
For the innovative manner in which importance of waste management and cleanliness were displayed in this festival, I congratulate the people of Raipur Municipal Corporation, the entire populace of Chhattisgarh, its government and administration.
Every year on March 8, ‘International Women’s Day’ is celebrated.
There are many programs that are held in our country and the world.
Today, it is our duty to ensure the participation of women in every field of life, be it social or economic life, it is our fundamental duty.
There were about one lakh ‘Sakhi Mandals,’ 14 lakh women, 2 thousand women Panchayat representatives, 29 thousand water carriers, 10 thousand female cleaners and 50 thousand women masons were involved in this campaign.
You can imagine what a mammoth undertaking it was!
These women of Jharkhand have shown that women power is an integral component of ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’, which will change the course of the campaign of cleanliness in general life, the effective role of hygiene in the nature of the people ingeneral.
My dear Brothers and sisters, I was just watching the TV news two days ago that electricity has reached three villages of the Elephanta island after 70 years of independence, and this has led to much joy and enthusiasm among the people there.
You all know very well, that Elephanta is located 10 kms by the sea from Mumbai.
It is a very important tourist destination.
I congratulate the administration and the populace there.
I am glad that now the villages of Elephanta and the caves of Elephanta will be lighted due to electrification.
This is not just electricity, but a new beginning of a period of development.
There is no greater contentment and joy than the fact that the lives of the countrymen be full of shine and there be happiness in their lives.
My dear brothers and sisters, we just celebrated the festival of Shivaratri.
And now the month of March beckons us with ripe crops in the fields, playful golden earrings of wheat and the captivating blossom of mango pleasing to the mind are the highlights of this month.
In The festival of Holi, the importance of colors is as important as the ceremony of ‘HolikaDahan’ because it is the day when we burn our inherent vices in the fire.
Holi makes us forget our rancours and gives us an opportunity to be a part of each other’s happiness and glad tidings, and it conveys the message of love, unity and brotherhood.
I wish a very joyous festival of Holi to all my countrymen, I further wish you colour laden felicitations.

Ladies and Gentlemen
On the side lines of the Summit, I hope you shall have some time to see the history and splendor of this city.
This summit is a re-inforcement of India’s commitment to a sustainable planet, for ourselves and for future generations.
As a nation, we are proud of our long history and tradition of harmonious co-existence between man and nature.
Respect for nature is an integral part of our value system.
Our traditional practices contribute to a sustainable lifestyle.
Our goal is to be able to live up to our ancient texts which say, “Keep pure For the Earth is our Mother and we are her children”.
This is the ideal we seek to live through our actions.
We believe that all resources and all wealth belongs to Nature and the Almighty.
We are just the trustees or managers of this wealth.
Mahatma Gandhi too, advocated this trusteeship philosophy.
India believes in growth but is also committed to protecting the environment.
It already has one hundred and twenty one members.
According to the UNEP Gap Report, India is on track to meet its Copenhagen Pledge of reducing the emissions intensity of its GDP by twenty to twenty-five percent over 2005 levels by 2020.
We are also on track to meet the 2030 Nationally Determined Contribution.
The UN Sustainable Development Goals put us on the path of equality, equity and climate justice.
While we are doing everything that is required of us, we expect that others also join in to fulfil their commitments based on Common but Differentiated Responsibility and equity.
We must also stress on climate justice for all vulnerable populations.
We in India are focused on Ease of living –through Good Governance, Sustainable Livelihood and through Cleaner Environment.
The campaign for clean India has moved from the streets of Delhi to every nook and corner of the country.
Cleanliness leads to better hygiene, better health, better working conditions and there-by better income and life.
We have also launched a massive campaign to ensure that our farmers convert agricultural waste to valuable nutrients, instead of burning them.
We are also happy to host the 2018 World Environment Dayton highlight our commitment and our continuing partnership to make the world a cleaner place.
We also recognize the need to tackle the issue of water availability, which is becoming a major challenge.
That is why we have introduced the massive Namami Gange initiative.
This programme, which has already started giving results, will soon revive the Ganga, our most precious river.
Our country is primarily agrarian.
Continued availability of water for agriculture is of importance.
The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojanahas been launched to ensure that no farm goes without water.
Our motto is ‘More crop, per drop.’
India has a fairly decent report card on bio-diversity conservation.
With only two point four percent of the world’s land area, India harbors 7-8 percent of the recorded species diversity, while supporting nearly eighteen percent of human population.
India has gained international recognition for ten out of its eighteen Biosphere reserves under UNESCO’s Man and Biosphere programme.
This is a testimony that our development is green and our wildlife is robust.
India has always believed in making the benefits of good governance reach everyone.
Our mission of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas is an extension of this philosophy.
Through this philosophy, we are ensuring that some of our most deprived areas experience social and economic progress on par with others.
Yet, there are many in India and outside who are struggling in the absence of these solutions.
People are forced to use un-healthy cooking techniques that cause indoor air pollution.
I have been told that the smoke in a rural kitchen resulting from this is a serious health hazard.
Yet, few talk about it.
Keeping this in view we have launched two far-reaching initiatives- Ujjwala and Saubhagya.
From the time that they were launched, these schemes have already impacted the lives of millions.
We recognize that only a healthy nation can lead the process of development.
Keeping this in mind, we have launched the world’s largest government funded health scheme.
The programme will support hundred million poor families.
Our ‘Housing for All’ and ‘Power for All ’initiatives also stem from this same agenda of providing the basic amenities of life to those who cannot afford them.
You know that India is one sixth of the global community.
Our development needs are enormous.
Our poverty or prosperity will have direct impact on the global poverty or prosperity.
People in India have waited too long for access to modern amenities and means of development.
We have committed to complete this task sooner than anticipated.
However, we have also said that we will do all this in a cleaner and greener way.
To give you just a few examples.
We have launched the Make in India campaign for this.
However, at the same time, we are insisting on Zero defect and zero effect manufacturing.
As the world’s fastest growing major economy, our energy needs are immense.
Even for cargo movement to long distances, we have started working on national water-way systems.
Each of our states is preparing an action plan against climate change.
This will ensure that while we are working towards conserving our environment, we also safe-guard our most vulnerable areas.
One of our largest states, Maharashtra, has already adopted a plan of its own in this direction.
We intend to achieve each of our sustainable development objectives on our own, but collaboration remains the key.
Collaboration between governments, between industries, and between people.
The developed world can help us achieve them faster.
Successful climate action needs access to financial resources and technology.
Technology can help countries like India develop sustainably and enable the poor to benefit from it.
We are here today to act upon the belief that we as humans can make a difference to this planet.
We need to understand that this planet, our Mother Earth, is one.
And so, we should rise above our trivial differences of race, religion, and power, and act as one to save her.
With our deep rooted philosophy of co-existence with nature and co-existence with each other, we invite you to join us in the journey of making this planet a more safe and sustainable place.
I wish the World Sustainable Development Summit a great success.
Bilateral cooperation in the field of food processing between India and Japan will be mutually beneficial to the food processing sector in both countries.

The Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Bill, 2018 was introduced in Parliament on 18th July, 2018 and was referred to the SCF, which submitted its Seventieth Report on the said Bill to Parliament on 3rd January, 2019.
The official amendments will further strengthen the Bill in its objective to effectively tackle the menace of illicit deposit taking activities in the country, and prevent such schemes from duping poor and gullible people of their hard earned savings.
• The Bill contains a substantive banning clause which bans Deposit Takers from promoting, operating, issuing advertisements or accepting deposits in any Unregulated Deposit Scheme.
The principle is that the Bill would ban unregulated deposit taking activities altogether, by making them an offence ex-ante rather than the existing legislative-cum-regulatory framework which only comes into effect ex-post with considerable time lags;
• The Bill creates three different types of offences, namely, running of Unregulated Deposit Schemes, fraudulent default in Regulated Deposit Schemes, and wrongful inducement in relation to Unregulated Deposit Schemes.
• “Deposit Takers” include all possible entities (including individuals) receiving or soliciting deposits, except specific entities such as those incorporated by legislation;
• “Deposit” is defined in such a manner that deposit-takers are restricted from camouflaging public deposits as receipts, and at the same time, not to curb or hinder acceptance of money by an establishment in the ordinary course of its business; and

I am pleased to return to a region, known to India since ancient times as Swarnabhoomi, (the land of gold).
I am also happy to be here in a special year.
In a land-mark year of India’s relationship with ASEAN.
The ASEAN-India Summit was a testimony of our commitment to ASEAN, and to our Act East policy.
For thousands of years, Indians have turned to the East.
Not just to see the Sun rise, but also to pray for its light to spread over the entire world.
I am here to say that the future we seek does not have to be as elusive as Shangri La; that we can shape this region in our collective hopes and aspirations.
Free and fearless in their choices.
Singapore also shows that when nations stand on the side of principles, not behind one power or the other, they earn the respect of the world and a voice in international affairs.
And, when they embrace diversity at home, they seek an inclusive world outside.
For India, though, Singapore means more.
It was cast in peace and friendship, religion and culture, art and commerce, language and literature.
Over the past three decades, we have re-claimed that heritage to restore our role and relationships in the region.
For India, no region now receives as much attention as this.
Lothal, in my home state Gujarat, was among the world’s oldest ports.
Even today there are remains of a dock.
No wonder Gujaratis are enterprising and travel widely even today!
The Indian Ocean has shaped much of India’s history.
It now holds the key to our future.
The ocean carries 90% of India’s trade and our energy sources.
It is also the life line of global commerce.
The Indian Ocean connects regions of diverse cultures and different levels of peace and prosperity.
And, a significant part of our overseas investments flow in this direction.
ASEAN alone accounts for over 20%.
Our interests in the region are vast, and our engagement is deep.
In the Indian Ocean region, our relationships are becoming stronger.
We are also helping build economic capabilities and improve maritime security for our friends and partners.
We promote collective security through forums like Indian Ocean Naval Symposium.
We are advancing a comprehensive agenda of regional co-operation through Indian Ocean Rim Association.
And, we also work with partners beyond the Indian Ocean Region to ensure that the global transit routes remain peaceful and free for all.
South-east Asia is our neighbour by land and sea.
With each Southeast Asian country, we have growing political, economic and defence ties.
With ASEAN, from dialogue partners, we have become strategic partners over the course of 25 years.
We pursue our relations through annual summits and 30 dialogue mechanisms.
But even more through a shared vision for the region, and the comfort and familiarity of our old links.
Beyond East and Southeast Asia, our partnerships are strong and growing.
It is a measure of our strategic autonomy that India’s Strategic Partnership, with Russia, has matured to be special and privileged.
Ten days ago in an informal summit at Sochi, President Putin and I shared our views on the need for a strong multi-polar world order for dealing with the challenges of our times.
At the same time, India’s global strategic partnership with the United States has overcome the hesitations of history and continues to deepen across the extraordinary breadth of our relationship.
It has assumed new significance in the changing world.
No other relationship of India has as many layers as our relations with China.
We are the world’s two most populous countries and among the fastest growing major economies.
Our cooperation is expanding.
Trade is growing.
And, we have displayed maturity and wisdom in managing issues and ensuring a peaceful border.
In April, a two-day informal Summit with President Xi helped us cement our understanding that strong and stable relations between our two nations are an important factor for global peace and progress.
I firmly believe that, Asia and the world will have a better future when India and China work together in trust and confidence, sensitive to each other’s interests.
At its core are cooperation based on Africa’s requirements, and a history of warmth and mutual respect.
Coming back to our region, India’s growing engagement is accompanied by deeper economic and defence cooperation.
We have more trade agreements in this part of the world than in any other.
We have Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreements with Singapore, Japan and South Korea.
On way from Indonesia, I stopped over briefly in Malaysia to meet one of ASEAN’s most senior leaders, Prime Minister Mahathir.
They train, exercise and conduct goodwill missions across the region.
We will start a new tri-lateral exercise with Singapore soon and we hope to extend it to other ASEAN countries.
We work with partners like Vietnam to build mutual capabilities.
India conducts Malabar Exercise with the United States and Japan.
A number of regional partners join in India’s Exercise Milan in the Indian Ocean, and participate in RIMPAC in the Pacific.
We are active in the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia – in this very city.
We will sustain growth of 7.5 to 8% per year.
More than any where else, our ties will deepen and our presence will grow in the region.
But, the future we seek to build needs a stable bedrock of peace.
And, this is far from certain.
There are shifts in global power, change in the character of global economy and daily disruption in technology.
This is a world of inter-dependent fortunes and failures.
And, no nation can shape and secure it on its own.
I see ASEAN as an example and inspiration.
ASEAN represents the greatest level of diversity of culture, religion, language, governance and prosperity of any grouping in the world.
Yet, today, ASEAN has united ten countries behind a common purpose.
ASEAN unity is essential for a stable future for this region.
And, each of us must support it, not weaken it.
I have attended four East Asia Summits.
I am convinced that ASEAN can integrate the broader region.
In many ways, ASEAN is already leading the process.
The East Asia Summit and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership – two important initiatives of ASEAN – embrace this geography.
It is also home to a vast array of global opportunities and challenges.
I am increasingly convinced with each passing day that the destinies of those of us who live in the region are linked.
Today, we are being called to rise above divisions and competition to work together.
The ten countries of South East Asia connect the two great oceans in both the geographical and civilizational sense.
 
 
Southeast Asia is at its centre.
And, ASEAN has been and will be central to its future.
That is the vision that will always guide India, as we seek to cooperate for an architecture for peace and security in this region.
We believe that our common prosperity and security require us to evolve, through dialogue, a common rules-based order for the region.
And, it must equally apply to all individually as well as to the global commons.
It also means that when nations make international commitments, they must uphold them.
We should all have equal access as a right under international law to the use of common spaces on sea and in the air that would require freedom of navigation, unimpeded commerce and peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with international law.
When we all agree to live by that code, our sea lanes will be pathways to prosperity and corridors of peace.
We will also be able to come together to prevent maritime crimes, preserve marine ecology, protect against disasters and prosper from blue economy.
This region, and all of us, have benefitted from globalisation.
Indian food is among the best examples of these benefits!
But, there is growing protectionism – in goods and in services.
Solutions cannot be found behind walls of protection, but in embracing change.
What we seek is a level playing field for all.
India stands for open and stable international trade regime.
That is what we expect from Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.
RCEP must be comprehensive, as the name suggests, and the principles declared.
It must have a balance among trade, investment and services.
Connectivity is vital.
It does more than enhance trade and prosperity.
India has been at the crossroads for centuries.
We understand the benefits of connectivity.
There are many connectivity initiatives in the region.
On these principles, we are prepared to work with everyone.
We will keep our economy open and our engagement transparent.
We will share our resources, markets and prosperity with our friends and partners.
We will seek a sustainable future for our planet, as through the new International Solar Alliance together with France and other partners.
This is how we wish ourselves and our partners to proceed in this vast region and beyond.
The ancient wisdom of the region is our common heritage.
Lord Buddha’s message of peace and compassion has connected us all.
Together, we have contributed much to human civilisation.
But, there is also a path of wisdom.
The signing of the Film co-production agreement will lead to mutual exchange of art and culture, create goodwill and better understanding among the people of both the countries as well as various aspects of film making.
Your doing so will go a long way in building a New India.

My dear countrymen, namaskar!
A while ago, I had a chance to have an indirect dialogue, with young friends from Karnataka.
The Times Group Newspaper “Vijaya Karnataka” started a new initiative urging the children to write a letter to the Prime Minister of the country.
And, then they published some selected letters.
And if we impart knowledge about nature to our children then in future they may prove very useful in protecting the environment.
A child Reeda Nadaf from Laxmeshwara has written that she is the daughter of an army man and feels proud of being so.
Which Indian would not be proud of our soldiers?
And, you being a soldier’ daughter should naturally take pride in that.
Irfana Begum from Kalburgi has written that her school is 5 Kilometres away from her village and she has to start early in the morning and it gets quite late in the evening by the time she returns home.
The Constitution of India is the spirit of our democracy.
This is the day to remember the members of the Constituent Assembly.
They all worked hard for about three years to draft the Constitution.
And, whoever reads that debate will feel proud about what actually the vision of a life dedicated to the nation is.
Now, this is the responsibility of all of us to make a New India in the light of the thinking of the makers of our Constitution.
Our Constitution is all encompassing.
There probably is no area, no aspect of nature which remained untouched.
He was playing a pivotal role in it.
The Constitution of India, which we feel so very proud of, bears an indelible stamp of his able leadership.
Sardar Saheb was also a member of the constituent Assembly.
He was also the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on fundamental rights, minorities and tribals.
26/11 is our Constitution Day but how can the nation forget that on this very day nine years ago, terrorists had launched an attack on Mumbai.
The country remembers and bows to those brave citizens, policemen, security men and each one who lost their lives then.
This country can never forget their sacrifice.
Terrorism has taken an ugly shape and has become a global threat almost as a daily routine.
We, in India, are facing to lot for the last 40 years on account of terrorism.
Thousands of our innocent people have lost their lives.
Terrorism has threatened humanity across the globe.
So, not only India but all humanitarian forces will have to keep fighting unitedly to defeat the menace of terrorism.
Lord Budha, Lord Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Mahatma Gandhi – this is the land which gave the message of love and non-violence to the world.
Terrorism and extremism are trying to weaken and destroy our social fabric.
That is why, the need of the hour is that humanitarian forces should become more alert and cautious.
My dear countrymen, we shall observe Navy Day on the 4th of December.
Indian Navy secures and protects our maritime boundaries.
I congratulate all those who belong to the Navy.
All of you must be knowing that our civilization developed along river banks.
Be it the Indus, the Ganges, the Yamuna or the Saraswati – our rivers and seas are both economically and strategically important.
These are our gateway to the whole world.
This country, our land has an unbreakable bond with oceans.
And as we peep into our history, we come to know that about 800 to 900 (eight to nine hundred) years ago, during the rule of the Cholas, the Chola Navy was considered one of the strongest navies.
This navy had a big role in the expansion of the Chola-rule and in making it an economic super power.
Numerous references of voyages and expeditions of the Chola-Navy are found even today in “Sangam – literature”.
Very few people might be aware that most navies of the world allowed women on their warships pretty later.
The Chola rulers possessed a very rich and sound knowledge of ship building.
When we talk of navy, who can ignore Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the capabilities & might of his navy.
Konkan coast, where the sea has a significant role, was under Shivaji Maharaj’s realm.
Many forts associated with Shivaji Maharaj like Sindhu Durg, Murud Janjira, Swarn Durg, etc were either situated on the sea coast or were encircled by sea.
The security of these forts was the responsibility of the Maratha Navy.
There was a combination of large ships and small boats in the Maratha Navy.
His naval forces were very efficient and skilled in attacking the enemy and in defending their attacks.
And how can we refer to the Maratha Navy and not remember Kanhoji Aangre!
He took the Maratha Navy to newer heights and established Maratha Naval Bases at a number of places.
After Independence, our Indian Navy showed its valour on various occasions; be it the liberation struggle of Goa or the Indo-Pak war.
When we talk of the Navy, we see only war but the Indian Navy has come forward in humanitarian ventures as well.
In June this year when Cyclone Mora hit Bangladesh and Myanmar, our naval ship INS SUMITRA rendered a big help in rescue operations; many fishermen were rescued from the sea and handed over to Bangladesh.
In May-June this year when there was a severe flood in Sri Lanka, three ships of our navy reached there immediately and helped the government and the people there.
In September, during the Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh, our naval ship INS GHADIYAL delivered humanitarian assistance there.
They sacrifice their youth for the country so that 125 crore countrymen may live in peace.
We observe ARMED FORCES FLAG DAY every year on 7th December.
This is a day to feel proud of and show respect to our country’s armed forces.
I am happy that the Ministry of Defence has decided to run a campaign from December 1 to December 7 during which they will reach out to the people of the country to disseminate information about our ARMED FORCES and to make them aware.
Throughout the week every one, old or young, should wear the flag.
A movement to instill respect for our forces will come into being in the country.
We can distribute ARMED FORCES FLAGS on this occasion.
Experiences and acts of valour of those from the armed forces who are our neighbours or acquaintances and related videos and pictures can be posted on hash-tag armed forces flag day (#armedforcesflagday).
People from the forces could be invited to schools and colleges to share information about the forces.
Our new generation can get a good opportunity to get information about the forces.
This is also an occasion to collect funds for the welfare of the jawans of our armed forces.
This amount is spent through the Sainik Kalyan Board on the dependents of those who lost their lives and also for those who got injured during wars, for their rehabilitation.
More information about sending in monetary contributions can be had on kbs.gov.in.
You can also make cashless payment for this.
Come, let us do something on this occasion which may raise the morale of our armed forces.
We should also contribute towards their welfare.
My dear countrymen, World Soil Day is on the 5th of December.
I want to tell something to my farmer brothers and sisters.
I had heard about the farmers, of Tohoo village in Bhoranj block of Hamirpur district in Himachal Pradesh.
Some enlightened and alert farmers in the village noticed and understood the gravity of the situation, and after that got their soil tested on time and followed the advice about the quantity of fertilizers, micro-nutrients and organic fertilizers to be used.
Besides, the soil quality also improved.
Cut in fertilizer usage resulted in monetary saving.
I am very glad to see that my farmer brothers have come forward to implement the suggestions made in the soil health card and as better results are showing, they are getting more and more inspired.
And, now the farmer also realizes that proper soil care is needed if production is to be increased and that if we take care of our soil, it will also care for all of us.
Our farmers across the country have got more than 10 crore soil health cards made so that they may understand their soil better and accordingly sow the crop.
A transformation shall start to usher into the life of the farmer.
All of us are experiencing Global warming, climate change now.
There was a time when winter would set in even before Diwali.
And now, December is knocking on our doors, yet winter is advancing at a leisurely pace.
But the moment winter sets in, we all have experienced that we don’t like coming out of our quilts one bit.
Despite such inclement weather there are some extraordinarily aware people who deliver results that are exemplary and inspiring for all of us.
You will be amazed to learn that Tushar, an eight year old differently – abled, divyang lad from Madhya Pradesh had taken a firm resolve to make his village Open defecation free.
It was a young boy vis-à-vis an enormous task at hand.
We get to learn something or the other every moment.
They are performing well in every walk of life.
Whether it be the field of sports, any kind of competition or a social initiative, our Divyang brethren are second to none.
Myriad competitions take place all over the country.
Recently, the 17th National Para-Swimming Competition was held in Udaipur.
Divyang brothers & sisters from different parts of the country participated & displayed their stellar skills.
‘Hello Mr. Prime Minister, I am Neerja Singh calling from Kanpur.
(End of phone call)
You are quite right that 2017 is near completion, and the year 2018 is knocking on the door.
And you have given some sound advice.
But continuing from your point of view I feel like adding something more to it and modifying it a bit.
And as in our villages, our elders, the old people of the village are always reminding us – forget the sorrow but also do not forget the joy.
You too forget your sorrow and also do not forget the joy.
I think we should propagate this wisdom.
We must usher in the auspicious in 2018, enter the New Year with the resolution of the auspicious
We know that in our part of the world, and probably all around the world around the ending of the year we take a stock, contemplate, and draw plans for the next year.
In our media many interesting events of the year gone by are broadcast again to reflect on the previous year.
The previous year is both a mixture of both positive and negative memories.
And I will definitely share the positive thoughts that arrive on #positiveindia (hashtag positive India) with the rest of our denizens in the next episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat.’
My dear countrymen, I will be back amidst you next month, with another episode of ‘Mann Ki Baat.’
We will have another opportunity to talk a lot.
Many – Many thanks!

Sisters and brothers of Kerala,
I congratulate you for completion of this bypass, which will make life easier for the people.
With this commitment, my government gave the final sanction to this project in January 2015.
Many such projects are in various such stages of development.
In our country, we have often seen that infrastructure projects get stalled after announcement for various reasons.
A lot of public money is wasted due to cost and time over-runs.
We decided that this culture of wastage of public money cannot continue.
Through PRAGATI, we are accelerating projects and overcoming this problem.
On the last Wednesday of every month, I sit with all secretaries of government of India and chief secretaries of state governments and review such delayed projects.
I was surprised to see that some projects are 20 to 30 years old and are hugely delayed.
From national highways to rural roads, pace of construction has almost doubled as compared to the previous government.
I am sure that we will definitely achieve the target of 100% soon.
As in road sector my government has given priority to railways, waterways and airways.
Regional air connectivity has also improved immensely in last four years.
The rate of doubling electrification and laying of new tracks has shown big improvement.
All this is also leading to increase in job creation.
My commitment is for the development of each of my countrymen.
The last man in the queue is my priority.
My government has sanctioned a new fund of 7,5 00 crore rupees for the fisheries sector.
I request the Government of Kerala to expedite the implementation of this scheme, so that the people of Kerala can take advantage of it.

Distinguished Delegation Members,
Friends from the Media,
I am pleased to welcome Prime Minister Trudeau on his official visit to India.
Although,as Prime Minister this is his first India visit, however, he had visited India in 1983 with his father Mr. Pierre Trudeau, the then Prime Minister of Canada.
Mr. Prime Minister your visit was long awaited.
We are delighted that you have come with your wife and children.
We are also delighted that you have visited several Indian cities prior to our today’s meeting.
My visit to Canada in 2015 was the first bilateral visit of any Indian Prime Minister in 42 years.
I had visited Vancouver, Toronto and Ottawa during the visit.
I experienced the love and affection of the people of Canada towards India.
I believe that Prime Minister Trudeau would have also experienced the warmth and natural brotherhood towards Canada in India.
He would have experienced the diversity of our country and the vibrancy of our democracy.
India places high importance in taking forward its strategic partnership with Canada.
Our relations are based on democracy, pluralism, supremacy of rule of law and mutual contacts.
India and Canada can work together in every sector: from trade and investment to energy; from science and innovation to education and skill development; and from oceans to the space.
In our today’s meeting, we reviewed all aspects of our mutual relations and identified the solid measures for increasing the mutual cooperation.
First of all, we agreed to strengthen our security cooperation.
Terrorism and militancy are a threat for democratic and pluralistic society like India and Canada.
It’s important for us to come together to face these forces.
There should not be any place for those who use community for political purposes and for creating rift.
Also, those who challenge the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of our countries cannot be tolerated.
Prime Minister Trudeau and I have agreed to fight terrorism and militancy.
Our NSAs have also met earlier.
They have finalised the Framework for Cooperation on Countering Terrorism and Violent Extremism.
We have also reviewed our economic relations.
We have agreed that we will further deepen the economic relations between Canada and India.
India’s rapid and constant economic growth and economic reforms provide ample opportunities.
Canada’s pension fund continues to be a powerful partner in India’s infrastructure development.
Today we will also get an opportunity to talk to the CEOs of both the countries.
Canada is an important destination for Indian students for higher studies.
Today, more than one hundred and twenty thousand Indian students are there in Canada.
The MoU on higher education which has been renewed today will helpfacilitate the increased movement of students and teachers of both the sides.
In order to increase the movement of skilled professionals and to facilitate their movement, I have requested the Prime Minister Trudeau.
Both our countries will benefit from this and it will make the economy of Canada more competitive.
There are ample opportunities in our technology partnership.
Our scientists and researchers have been discovering the new technologies and systems and these will have a positive impact on both the countries – Canada and India.
Canada was a partner country in the Technology Summit, 2017.
Our governments have also agreed to strengthen the cooperation in the field of information and communication technology.
Canada has been an energy super power and it can meet our growing energy requirements.
Today we have decided to expand our energy dialogue and to prepare the contours of the future of our energy partnership.
The strength of our cooperation in the field of atomic energy is being reflected in the unhindered supply of uranium.
Today, we have been adding nuclear science, technology and innovation to our cooperation.\
My friend Prime Minister Trudeau and I have exchanged our ideas on the regional and global situation.
Our views are similar on the issues of the freedom of navigation in Indo-Pacific; on the dangers of the links of proliferation related to North Korea; and on the restoration of democratic institutions in Maldives.
We have agreed to strengthen the cooperation in the field of establishment of peace and also on giving special attention for capacity building in the third countries.
People-to-people contact is the solid base for our strategic partnership.
India is proud of the achievements of Indian community in Canada.
I’m delighted to note that the Prime Minister has brought several of them along with him in this visit.
We are committed for building friendship and harmony with the Indian community in Canada and we want their active participation in India’s progress and development.
India-Canada is a natural partnership of shared values.
My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
Just a while ago, from the 4th of April to the 15th of April, the 21st Commonwealth Games were held in Australia.
71 countries, including India, participated therein.
Our sportspersons too lived up to the countrymen’s expectations and displayed stellar performances, winning one medal after another.
This success makes every Indian swell with pride.
After the conclusion of a match, representing India, when the athletes draped in the tricolor rise, displaying their medals, the notes of the National Anthem being played evoke a sense of joy and fulfillment, glory and honour.
This is very, very special in itself.
At the same time, it was special.
And let me tell you, the best out of the best interns who have strived in schools & colleges with excellent work will be rewarded with recognition at the national level.
Not just that, those interns who accomplish their tasks well, will be awarded two credit points each, by the UGC.
Once again, I invite students & young people, boys & girls to avail of the benefits of the internship.
You can register yourselves for the ‘Swachch Bharat Summer Internship’ on Mygov.
I hope our youth will lend a hand in taking this movement of cleanliness forward.
I too am eager to know more about your efforts.
Let us turn this vacation into a learning opportunity, for a totally new experience.
I try to watch “Good News India” programme on Doordarshan whenever I get a chance and I would appeal to my countrymen that we all should also watch this “Good News India” programme wherein we get to know as to how many people in various parts of our country are doing many good things and that such good things are happening.
Recently, I saw that they were presenting the story of some youth from Delhi who are selflessly working in a dedicated manner to help in educating the poor children.
This group of youngsters has started a big campaign in Delhi for providing education to the street children and slum dwellers.
Initially, shocked to see the condition of children begging around or doing some menial jobs that this group of youngsters got dedicatedly, selflessly involved into this creative mission.
These farmers have formed a cooperative society in Munar village and set-up a biscuit factory there.
Impressed by the bold initiative of these farmers, the administration has also linked this to the National Livelihood Mission.
These biscuits are now being supplied upto Almora and Kousani besides being sold to about fifty Aanganwadi kendras in Bagheshwar district.
With the hard work of these farmers, the annual turnover of the society has gone up from 10 to 15 lakh rupees and with more than 900 families getting employment here, people have stopped migrating to other places.
If you happen to go to Rajasthan, you must visit Chand Baodi.
This is one of the biggest and the most beautiful baodis of India and the point to be noted is that this is situated in a water-scarce area.
April, May, June and July is the most suitable time when rain water harvesting can be done and if we make preparations in advance, we can reap a rich harvest.
Budget under MNREGA is also utilized for this water conservation activity.
During the last three years, everyone in his or her own way has contributed towards water conservation and water management.
In last three years, nearly 150 lakh hectares of land got more benefit through water conservation and water management measures.
Some people have really benefitted very well from MNREGA budget provisions made by the Government of India for water conservation and water management works.
They succeeded in reviving the dried out Sasur Khaderi river with the help and cooperation of people from 40-45 villages of the area.
This grand achievement is a big boon for animals, birds, farmers, crops and villages.
I emphasis that once again April, May, June and July are before us and we must also take up some responsibility for water harvesting and water conservation, we should also chalk out some schemes, we should also do and show something.
When “Mann Ki Baat” approaches I receive messages, letters and phone calls from all sides.
Aayan Kumar Banerjee from Devi Tola village of North 24 Parganas in West Bengal in his comment on My Gov has written – “We celebrate Rabindra Jayanti every year but many people are not aware of the Nobel Laureate Rabindra Nath’s philosophy of living peacefully, aesthetically and with integrity.
Kindly discuss this point in “Mann Ki Baat” programme so that more and more people may get to know about this.”
I thank Aayanji for drawing the attention of all listeners of “Mann Ki Baat” towards this point.
Gurudev Tagore was a personality full of knowledge and intellect whose writings left an indelible mark on everyone.
Rabindra Nath was a personality full of talent, a multi – directional personna but a teacher in his inner self can always be felt.
He has written in Gitanjali – “ He, who has the knowledge has the responsibility to impart it to the students.”
And, whenever I got a chance to listen to poems like Anandloke and Aaguner, Poroshmoni, I used to feel as if my mind was being energised.
You must also have been impressed by Rabindra Sangeet and his poems.
I pay my respectful homage to Rabindra Nath Tagore.
Within a few days from now the holy month of Ramazan will dawn upon us.
The month of Ramazan is celebrated with full reverence and respect throughout the world.
The sociological and collective aspect of fasting is that when a person experiences hunger himself, he comes to realize the hunger of others.
When he is thirsty, he realizes the thirst of others.
This is an opportunity to remember the teachings of Prophet Muhammad-peace be upon him- and his message.
It is our responsibility to follow the path of equality and brotherhood as morals from his life.
Prophet Mohammad Sahib(peace be upon him) believed that if you possessed anything more than your requirement, then donate it to the needy, thus donation or giving alms is important during Ramzan.
People donate generously to the needy during this holy month.
Prophet Muhammad Sahib believed that a person is rich because of his inherent spirituality, and not materialistic wealth.
I wish all the citizens an auspicious month of Ramazan and I hope this opportunity will inspire people to follow the Prophet’s message of peace and goodwill.
Buddha Purnima is a special day for every Indian.
We must be proud of the fact that India is the birthplace of Lord Buddha, the very synonym of power of compassion, service and sacrifice, who guided millions of people around the world.
This Buddha Purnima reminds us of all of our obligation to emulate Lord Buddha’s teaching as well as, pledge ourselves to follow his footsteps.
Lord Buddha was the fountainhead of egalitarianism, peace, harmony and brotherhood.
These are human values, which are most desired in the world today.
Baba Saheb Dr. Ambedkar stressed that Lord Buddha has been a great inspiration in his social philosophy.
Baba Saheb had said –“My Social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words; liberty, equality and fraternity.
My Philosophy has roots in religion and not in political science.
I have derived them from the teaching of my master, The Buddha.”
Baba Saheb strengthened the oppressed, exploited, deprived and crores of people standing on the brink of marginalization via the Constitution of India.
There cannot be a bigger example of compassion than this.
This form of compassion was one of the greatest qualities of Lord Buddha for the alleviation of suffering of the people.
We have inherited the wisdom of Lord Buddha throughout Asia as part of our legacy.
I wish people spread all over the world who revere Lord Buddha and believe in the principles of compassion- I wish all of them an auspicious Buddha Purnima.
I seek benediction from Lord Buddha for the entire world, so that we can fulfill our responsibility in building a peaceful and compassionate world based on his teachings.
The Indian diaspora was infused with new confidence.
It has been 20 years since Pokhranand this test was done on Buddha Purnima with the blessings of Lord Buddha.
India’s test was not only successful but in a way, India had demonstrated its might in the field of science and technology.
We can also say 11 May 1988 is engraved in the history of India as a demonstration of her military power.
Lord Buddha has shown the world- that the power of inner strength or that of the soul is necessary for peace.
Similarly, when you are sturdy as a nation, you can be at peace with others.
The month of May, 1998 is not just important for the country from the aspect that nuclear tests were conducted this very month, but the manner in which they were carried out is also important.
It has revealed to the entire world that India is the land of great scientists and with a strong leadership, India can reach loftier destinations and earn new laurels.
Synergize your energy with the strength of India.
Witnessing the journey that Atal ji started, we while continuing onwards on that very path with a renewed joy will derive great satisfaction in getting ahead.

My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
In everything associated with it like cuisine or attire, traditional norms are adhered to.
The unique festival Chhath Pooja is deeply linked with nature & worshiping nature.
The world respects & venerates those who rise; the Chatth Pooja bestows upon us the sanskaar to respect & revere those whose setting, whose dusk is imminent.
The expression of the significance of cleanliness in our lives is intrinsic to this festival.
It is natural for each one of us to feel proud of this great tradition of India.
My dear countrymen, ‘Mann – Ki – Baat’ has garnered accolades; it has also attracted criticism.
But whenever I look at the overall outcome of ‘Mann Ki Baat’, it reinforces my belief, that it is intrinsically, inseparably woven into the warp & weft of our common citizens’ lives, cent per cent.
Take the examples of Khadi and handloom.
On Gandhi Jayanti I have always advocated the use of handloom and Khadi.
What has it led to?
You will be glad to know that on the 17th of this month on the day of Dhanteras, the Khadi Gramodyog Bhavan store in Delhi witnessed a record sale of Rupees one crore, twenty lakhs.
You too must be feeling happy with a sense of satisfaction at this mega sale in just one Khadi & Handloom store.
During Diwali, Khadi gift coupon sales recorded an overwhelming 680 per cent rise.
Compared to last year, the total sales of Khadi & Handicrafts have risen almost by 90%.
One can clearly see that today, the youth, the elderly, women, in fact every age group is taking to Khadi & handloom.
I can imagine how many weaver families, poor families, and the families working on handlooms must have benefitted from this.
Khadi was Khadi foundation earlier and we talked of Khadi fashion but with my recent experience I can say that after Khadi for nation and Khadi for fashion now, it is becoming Khadi for transformation.
Khadi and handloom have transformed the lives of the poorest of the poor and are emerging as a powerful means of empowering them.
It is playing a very important role for gramodaya.
Shriman Rajan Bhatt has written on NarendramodiApp that he wants to know about my experience of celebrating Diwali with security forces and he also wants to know how the security forces celebrate Diwali.
We also feel that our homemade sweets must reach our country’s soldiers.
All of you must have celebrated Deepawali with traditional fervour.
To me, Diwali brought a special experience.
Luckily I got another chance to celebrate Deepawali with our courageous and brave heart security personnel.
Memories of Diwali celebrations with our security forces in Gurez sector of Jammu & Kashmir will stay long cherished in my heart.
On behalf of all our countrymen, I salute every soldier of our security forces who guard the country’s borders with utmost dedication and a spirit of sacrifice, braving all odds.
Whenever we get a chance or whenever there is an opportunity we must try to know the experiences of our soldiers and listen to their tales of valour.
Many of us may not be aware that the jawans of our security forces play an important role not only on our borders but they play a very vital role in establishing peace the world over.
As UN Peacekeepers, they are bringing glory to the nation in the comity of nations.
United Nations Day was observed recently all over the world on the 24th of October.
Everybody recalls the efforts and constructive role of the UN in establishing peace throughout the world.
And, we are believers in “Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam” which means the whole world is our family.
And with this belief, India has been cooperating very actively in various important initiatives taken by the UN.
You may be aware that the preface of the Indian Constitution and the preface of the UN Charter; both start with the words ‘We the people’.
India has always stressed on the importance of equality for women and the UN Declaration of Human Rights is a living example of this.
In its initial phrase, it was proposed as ‘all men are born free and equal’ which was amended and adopted as ‘all human beings are born free and equal’ with the efforts of the Indian representative Hansa Mehta.
It appears to be a minor change but it reflects a vision of a healthy thought.
India’s most important contribution under the UN umbrella is its role in UN Peacekeeping Operations.
India has always been extending active support to UN Peace Missions.
Presently, about seven thousand Indian soldiers are associated with UN Peacekeeping initiatives which is the third highest number of soldiers from any country.
Till August 2017, Indian soldiers had lent their services in about 50 of the total of 71 Peacekeeping operations undertaken by the UN the world over.
These operations have been carried out in Korea, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Congo, Cyprus, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan and many other parts of the world.
In Congo and Southern Sudan more than twenty thousand patients were treated in hospitals of the Indian army and countless lives were saved.
Indian security forces have not only saved people in various countries but also won their hearts with their people friendly operations.
Indian women have played a leading role in peace keeping efforts.
Very few people may know that India was the first country which sent a female police unit to Liberia for the United Nations Peace Mission.
And see how this initiative from India became a big source of motivation for other countries too.
Later, all countries started sending their women police units.
You will surely feel proud to know that India’s contribution is not limited to just peacekeeping operations but it is also providing training to peacekeepers from about eighty five countries.
The brave peacekeepers from this land of Mahatma Gandhi and Gautam Budha have sent a message of peace and amity around the world.
Peacekeeping operation is not an easy task.
Jawans from our security forces have to perform duties in difficult and remote areas.
They have to live amongst many different people.
They need to know and adapt to various situations and different cultures.
They have to mould themselves according to the local needs and environment.
While remembering our brave UN Peacekeepers today, who can forget the sacrifice of Captain Gurbachan Singh Salaria who laid down his life while fighting in Congo in Africa?
Every Indian feels proud while remembering him.
He was the only UN peacekeeper, a brave-heart, who was awarded the Param Veer Chakra.
General Thimaiyya, who had been India’s army chief, lead the UN Peacekeeping force in Cyprus and sacrificed everything for those peace efforts.
India has always been giving a message of peace, unity and harmony to the world.
We believe that everyone must live in peace and harmony and move ahead to carve a better and peaceful tomorrow.
My dear countrymen, our holy land has given great souls who selflessly served humanity.
Sister Nivedita, whom we also know as Bhagini Nivedita, was one such extraordinary person.
She was born in Ireland as Margret Elizabeth Noble but Swami Vivekanand gave her the name NIVEDITA.
And Nivedita means the one who is fully dedicated.
She later proved herself true to her name.
Yesterday was the 150th birth anniversary of Sister Nivedita.
She was so impressed by Swami Vivekanand that she renounced her happy- prosperous life and dedicated herself to the service of the poor.
Sister Nivedita felt very hurt by the atrocities of the British rule.
The Britishers not only made us slaves but they tried to enslave us mentally as well.
Constant efforts to belittle our culture and make us feel inferior were on.
Bhagini Nivedita ji revived the dignity and pride of Indian culture.
She brought the people together by infusing a sense of national-awakening.
She travelled to various countries and raised her voice against the mischievous propaganda against Sanatan Dharma and ideology.
Renowned nationalist and Tamil poet Subramanya Bharati is well known for his revolutionary poem Pudhumai Penn or New woman and is renowned for his efforts for Women empowerment.
It is said that Bhagini Nivedita was the inspiration.
Bhagini Nivedita ji also helped the great scientist Jagdish Chandra Basu.
She helped publication of Basu’s research and publicity through her articles and conferences.
This is India’s unique beauty that spirituality and science complement each other in our culture.
Thank you for your phone call.
First of all, many felicitations to all the children on the occasion of Children’s Day celebrated on the birthday of our first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru ji.
Children are the emerging heroes in the creation of new India.
Your concern is correct that the diseases which surfaced in old age, or emerged around the last lap of life – have started to appear in children nowadays.
It is indeed surprising today, when we hear that children are suffering from diabetes.
Such diseases were very rare in young people.
But our lifestyle has changed.
Today these diseases are known as ‘lifestyle disorders.’
One of the main reasons for being afflicted with such diseases at a young age is the lack of physical activity in our lifestyle and the changes in our eating habits.
Society and the family need to pay attention towards this crisis.
If you’ll start paying attention to it, you will see that there is no need to do anything extraordinary.
You just need to make small regular changes in order to transform your habits, making them a part of your way of life.
I would like the family to consciously try to inculcate in children the habit of playing in open grounds.
If possible, we can make the elder family members accompany these children to the playground and play with them.
The children can be made to take the stairs instead of taking the lift.
After dinner, the entire family can go for a walk with the children.
Yoga for Young India.
Yoga will be helpful for especially our young friends, in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and protecting them from lifestyle disorders.
The practice of Yoga 30 minutes before school can impart much benefit.
There are several studies being conducted on how Yoga is effective in curbing diabetes.
These studies are being carried out in AIIMS too and the results that have emerged so far are very encouraging.
Do not look at Ayurveda and Yoga as a means of medical treatment only; instead of this we should make them a part of our life.
My dear countrymen, especially my young friends, we have been getting glad tidings from the field of sports.
In different games, our athletes have made the country proud.
In hockey, India has won the Asia Cup hockey title through its dazzling performance.
Our players performed magnificently and on the basis of their sterling efforts, India has become the Asia Cup champion after an interval of ten years.
India had earlier won the Asia Cup in Hockey in the years 2003 and 2007.
I extend felicitations on behalf of the entire nation to the entire team and support staff.
After hockey, good news for India also came in badminton.
Badminton star Kidambi Srikanth has filled every Indian’s heart with pride by clinching the Denmark Open title with his excellent performance.
After Indonesia Open and Australia Open, this win has completed the triad of the super series premiere title.
I congratulate our young friend, Kidambi Srikanth for this feat and enhancing the prestige of India.
Friends, the FIFA Under-17 World Cup was organized this month.
Teams from all over the world came to India and all of them exhibited their skills on the football field.
I also got an opportunity to go and watch a match.
There was a lot of enthusiasm among the players and the spectators.
This world cup was a super event where the whole world was watching you.
Such a big spectacle, I was astounded to see the energy, enthusiasm, and zeal of all the young players.
The world cup was successfully organized and all the teams performed their best.
Regardless of the fact that India could not win the title, the young players of India won the hearts of everyone.
The whole world including India enjoyed this mega festival of sports and this whole tournament was both full of interest and entertainment for football lovers.
The signs that the future of football is very bright have started to appear.
I extend my congratulations and good wishes to all the players, their colleagues, and all the sports lovers once again.
My dear countrymen, a multitude of people write to me about ‘Swachch Bharat’, I feel that if I have to do justice to their feelings then I will have to do the program ‘Mann Ki Baat’ every day and every day ‘Mann Ki Baat’ will be dedicated solely to the subject of cleanliness.
Some listeners send photo graphs of the efforts undertaken by children whereas others mention the role of youth in these efforts.
Sometimes there is a story of an innovation to bring about cleanliness or winds of change that get ushered due to an official’s zeal.
A few days ago I received a very detailed report highlighting the story of transformation of Chandrapur Fort in Maharashtra.
An NGO called Ecological Protection Organization launched a cleanliness campaign in Chandrapur Fort.
In this campaign lasting for two hundred days, people performed the task of cleaning the fort, non-stop, without any fatigue and with team-work.
Just think Two-hundred-days of continuous labour!
They sent me photographs with a caption- ‘Before and After’!
I was overwhelmed on seeing these and whoever will see these photographs, no matter how upset he is on witnessing the filth around him, and wondering how the mission of cleanliness will be fulfilled – then I have to tell such people that you can see for yourself the toil, resolve and determination of the members of the Ecological Protection Organization, in these living pictures.
Just on seeing these pictures, your disappointment will transform into hope.
This mammoth effort of bringing about cleanliness is a wonderful example of fostering aesthetics, co-operation and continuum.
Forts are symbols of our heritage.
And it is the duty of all countrymen to keep our historical heritage safe and clean.
I congratulate Ecological Protection Organization, their entire team and the people of Chandrapur.
My dear countrymen, we’ll celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti on the 4th of November.
Guru Nanak Dev ji is not only the first guru of Sikhs; he’s guru to the entire world.
He envisioned the welfare of all humanity and considered all castes to be equal.
He stressed on women empowerment and respect for women.
Guru Nanak Dev ji undertook a 28 thousand kilometre journey on foot and throughout the journey spread the message of true humanity.
He entered into a dialogue with people and showed them the path of truth, sacrifice & dedication.
He advocated the message of equality in society, not through mere words but through concrete endeavour.
 
Partaking of LANGAR together created a feeling of unity & oneness in people.
 
In order to convey his ideals, Guru Nanak Dev ji composed the Gurbani.
 
  
 
All of us know that he was the one who laid the foundation stone of modern, unified India.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s speciality was that he not only put forth revolutionary ideas; he was immensely capable of devising practical solutions to the most complicated problems in the way.
Translating a thought into reality was his forte’.
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel took on the reins of weaving a unified India.
He ensured that millions of Indians were brought under the ambit of one nation & one constitution.
His decision making ability infused in him the strength to overcome all obstacles.
He set a definite goal and moved forward on its path with grit & determination.
These lofty ideals of Sardar Sahab are relevant to and inspiring for our vision for a New India, even today.
And that is why his birthday is celebrated as National Unity Day.
His contribution in giving a unified texture to the nation is without parallel.
On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Sahab, Run for Unity will be organized throughout the country, which will see the participation of children, youth, women, in fact people of all age groups.
I urge you to participate in Run for Unity, the festival of mutual harmony.
My dear countrymen, you must’ve returned to your respective routines after the Diwali vacation, with a new resolve, with a new determination.

My tributes to Dr. S Radhakrishnan, an outstanding teacher and statesman on his birth anniversary.
Teachers have a central role in realising our dream of a ‘New India’ that is driven by cutting edge research and innovation.

Prime Minister requested her to convey his best wishes to President Trump and warmly recalled their earlier meetings and interactions.

Both the dignitaries discussed ways to enhance India- US cooperation including on counter-terrorism and in multilateral fora.
They expressed confidence that strong India-US partnership will continue to be an important factor for global peace and prosperity.
Secretary Social Justice and Empowerment, Lata Krishna Rao ji;
I am really fortunate to dedicate the Dr. Ambedkar International Centre (DAIC) to the country.
Moreover, my joy has doubled due the fact that I had laid the foundation-stone for this international centre in April 2015.
This grand International Centre is ready not only in a very short time but before its scheduled time.
I congratulate every department associated with the construction of this centre.
I sincerely hope that this Centre will prove to be a great inspiration for spreading Babasaheb’s teachings.
Dr Ambedkar International Centre for socio-economic Transformation is a part of the Dr. Ambedkar International Centre.
The centre will also play a significant role for research in social and economic issues.
I won’t be wrong to say that the people today are more influenced by the ideas of Babasaheb than the family which was behind the conspiracy.
The London residence of Babasaheb is being transformed into a memorial by the BJP government of Maharashtra after its purchase.
Similarly, Ambedkar Memorial is being built on the land of Indu mill in Mumbai.
Deekshabhoomi is also being developed in Nagpur.
BHIM app has proved to be a boon for the poor, the Dalit, the backward and the exploited people.
I know today we are divided politically, socially, and economically.
But I am quite convinced that given time and circumstance nothing in the world will be able to prevent this country from becoming united.
With all our castes and creeds I have not the slightest hesitation that we shall in some form be a united people.
The type of conduct suggests that we have that capability of moving towards the path of unity by moving together with all the components.”
The person who had been the victim of social evils of the country was full of expectations.
Some people give more importance to the caste in which they have taken birth than the land on which they have taken birth.
I believe that today’s new generation is capable of eliminating these social evils.
Mainly the changes that have taken place in the past 15 to 20 years are only due to the efforts of the new generation.
They understand that the country is being divided on the basis of caste and the country cannot progress at the desired pace with these divisions.
“We should not be satisfied only with the political democracy.
We also have to make our political democracy a social democracy.
Political democracy cannot survive without a base of social democracy.”
The social democracy was the Mantra of freedom and equality for every Indian.
Even the basic amenities such as electricity connection, water connection, a small house, Life Insurance are far from accessible.
If you closely look at our government’s way of working and our work culture for the past 3 to 3 and a half years, you will notice that we have been trying to fulfil that dream of Babasaheb’s social democracy.
The schemes and the policies of this government focus upon strengthening the social democracy.
The presence of toilets in some houses and the absence of the same in the others used to create a division.
The government has also come up with insurance plans to strengthen social democracy.
So far 18 crore poor people of the country have joined the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana and Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana.
Through these schemes, a premium of only 1 Rupee per month is required for accident insurance and 90 Paisa per day for Life Insurance.
You will be surprised to know that under the schemes, a sum of rupees 1800 crores approximately has been given to the poor.
Just imagine today the poor in the rural areas are living a tension-free life.
Brothers and sisters, the essence of Babasaheb’s ideology has been rooted in many forms:
Equality of rights,
Equality of human dignity, and
Equality of opportunity.
Such issues have been raised by Babasaheb in his lifetime.
He always hoped that the governments in India would follow the Constitution without discriminating against different castes.
Today, in every scheme of this government you will see a glimpse of the efforts to give equal rights to all without discrimination.
Just recently the government has launched another scheme – ‘Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Har Ghar Bijli Yojana or Saubhagya scheme’.
Under the scheme, 4 crore such households will be provided free electricity connection that have been compelled to lead a life similar to the 18th century era, even after 70 years of independence.
The Saubhagya scheme is going to end this inequality that was prevailing since the past 70 years.
Even today there are millions of people in the country who do not have their own house.
It is important to have a house first, be it a small or a big one.
Therefore the government aims at providing every poor of the village and the city with his own house by the year 2022.
For this, the government is providing financial assistance.
Brothers and sisters, these programmes are moving at their determined speed and will be completed before their scheduled time.
This is not just from now but the direction was fixed within the first few months of our governance.
Similarly, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana was launched in July 2015.
So far more than 470 agricultural markets have been added online.
Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, which I mentioned earlier, was launched on 1st May last year.
The government has set a target of providing gas connections to 5 crore poor women by 2019.
In just 19 months, the government has given free gas connections to more than 3 crore 12 lakh women.
Brothers and sisters, this is our way of working.
The government is working on the same vision of Babasaheb of providing equal rights to the poor.
The government considers delays in the schemes as a criminal negligence.
Now if we consider this Centre, the decision of making it was taken in the year 1992.
But nothing happened for 23 years.
After coming to power this government had laid the foundation-stone of this centre and the same government has inaugurated it.
The political parties who ask for votes in the name of Babasaheb will probably not even be aware of this.
Well, nowadays they are thinking of Baba Bhole instead of Baba Saheb.
That’s enough.
While this centre has been completed before time, the deadlines for several other schemes are being reduced.
Lakhs of children and pregnant women were left out of vaccination.
But under this campaign, more than 2.5 crore children and more than 70 lakh pregnant women have been vaccinated.
The ‘Intensified Mission Indradhanush’ has been launched along with ‘Mission Indradhanush’ in order to achieve this goal.
Similarly, the government had set a target of 2022 to connect every village with the road but as soon as the project has gained momentum and the work is progressing at a rapid pace, we have planned to complete it by 2019 instead of 2022.
So, when we started the Stand-up India programme, we decided that every Bank branch should provide loans to at least one Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe through this scheme.
You will be surprised to know that about 60% of the beneficiaries of the Mudra Yojana, that changed the meaning of employment, belong to Dalit, backward and tribal classes.
Under the scheme loans of nearly 9.75 crore rupees have been sanctioned so far and loans of over 4 lakh crore rupees without a bank guarantee has been provided to the people.

India’s pride and among the highest medal winners for India in the 2018 CWG, Manika Batra
These brave hearts made the supreme sacrifice in securing the lives of a hundred & twenty five crore Indians.
In order to ensure that their fellow countrymen could sleep peacefully, these brave sons toiled relentlessly, day or night.
As a consequence of the Pulwama terror attack and the sacrifice of the brave jawans, people across the country are agonized and enraged.
All around, there is a deluge of strong feelings of sympathy for the martyrs & their family members.
I respectfully bow to all the brave sons of the country, who laid down their lives, protecting the honour of their motherland, India.
This martyrdom will keep inspiring us relentlessly to uproot the very base of terrorism; it will fortify our resolve.
Our armed forces have consistently displayed unparalleled courage and valour.
On the one hand, they have displayed exemplary capabilities in restoring peace; on the other, they have retaliated in equal measure, in a language the attackers understand.
You must have seen how within a hundred hours of the attack, retributive action was accomplished.
The Army has resolved to wipe out terrorists and their harbourers.
The martyrdom of these brave soldiers brought to the fore, through the media, touching, inspiring stories of their kin, whichgive hope and strength to the entire country.
The fortitude displayed by Ram Niranjanji, father of Martyr Ratan Thakur of Bhagalpur, Bihar, in this moment of tribulation is truly inspiring.
He has expressed the wish of sending his second son too, to take on the enemy; if need be, he himself would go and fight.
The country salutes the indomitable courage of Meenaji, wife of Martyr PrasannaSahu of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha.
She has vowed to send her only son to join the CRPF.
No martyr, no family is an exception to that.
Whether it be the family of Martyr Vijay Maurya of Devariya, the parents of Martyr Tilakraj of Kangra or the six year old son of Martyr Hemraj of Kota – the story of every family of martyrs is full of inspiration.
It is natural for our countrymen to be curious about it.
And I took a resolve that the country must have such a Memorial.
We decided to erect the National War Memorial and I am contented to see it attaining completion in so little a time.
Tomorrow, that is on the 25th of February, crores of we Indians will dedicate this National Soldiers’ Memorial to our Armed Forces.
On part of the nation, this will be a small step towards repaying a great debt.
This new memorial has been instituted in the heart of Delhi, in close vicinity of India Gate and Amar JawanJyoti.
I do believe that for our countrymen a visit to the National War Memorial will be akin to a pilgrimage to a holy place.
The National Soldiers’ Memorial is a symbol of the nation’s gratitude to those men who made the supreme sacrifice after we gained Independence.
The Memorial’s design symbolises the indomitable courage of our immortal soldiers.
The flame of the Amar Chakra symbolizes the immortality of the martyred soldier.
The second circle, Veerta Chakra, depicts the courage and bravery of our soldiers.
It is a gallery whose walls are inscribed with soldiers’ tales of valour.
This is followed by the Tyag Chakra.
This circle stands for the sacrifice of our soldiers.
This bears the names of soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice, in letters of gold.
Following that is the Rakshak Chakra which depicts the spirit of security.
This circle houses a row of dense trees.
These trees represent soldiers and send a reassuring message to the country’s citizens that our soldiers vigilantly guard borders round the clock and that they, the citizens are safe.
If you take a holistic view, the National Soldiers’ Memorial is sure to turn out to be a sacred site, where people will throng, to get information on our great martyrs, to express their gratitude, to conduct further research on them.
This place stands testimony to a series of sacrifices of men who laid down their lives for the sake of their country, so that we could live, so that the country could be safe & secure, paving the way for development.
One falls short of words in assessing the enormous contribution of our Armed Forces, Police and Para Military Forces in the strides of progress achieved by the country.
In the month of Octoberlast year, I was blessed with the opportunity to dedicate the National Police Memorial to the nation.
That too echoed the same sentiment, and we believe that we should be ever grateful to those policemen & police women, who relentlessly ensure our safety & security.
I do hope that you will pay a visit to the National Soldiers’ Memorial and the National Police Memorial.
He has written that on the 3rd of March, 1900, the British arrested BirsaMunda, when he was just 25 years old.
Paying tributes to BirsaMunda and Jamsetji Tata is, in a way, salutation to the glorious legacy and history of Jharkhand.
These two distinguished personalities brought glory &honour not just to Jharkhand, but the entire country.
The country is indeed grateful for their contribution.
Today, if an inspiring personality is required for ably guiding our youth, it certainly is that of BhagwanBirsaMunda.
The British tree treacherously arrested him when he was asleep, in a covert manner.
The fact is, when people are blessed with exemplary leadership, the might of arms pales in comparison to the collective will power of the people.
BhagwanBirsaMunda not only waged a struggle against the British for political freedom; he also actively fought for the social & economic rights of the tribal folk.
And he accomplished all this in his rather short life.
He let sunshine peep into the darkened lives of the deprived and the oppressed.
BhagwanBirsaMunda sacrificed his life at the tender age of twenty five.
Illustrious sons of Mother India, such as BirsaMunda have come into being in each & every part of the country.
There must’ve been hardly any part of India, which did not produce someone who contributed in the long freedom struggle,that spanned centuries.
But it’s a misfortune that these tales of valour and sacrifice did not reach the new generations.
If the valourousBhagwanBirsaMunda made us aware of our existence & identity, far-sightedJamsetji Tata created great institutions for the country.
Jamsetji Tata was a true visionary, who not only foresaw India’s future, but also duly laid strong foundations.
He knew very well that making India a hub of science, technology and industry was imperative for her future.
It was his vision that culminated in the establishment of the Tata Institute of Science, which we know as Indian Institute of Science today.
Not just that, he also established world renowned institutions and industries such as Tata Steel.
On a voyage to America, Jamsetji Tata met Swami Vivekananda on the ship, and an important topic of their discussion was the outreach & spread of Science & Technology in India.
Once again I pay my homage to a great leader like him.
They, by their diligence, are powering positive changes in the lives of others in myriad ways.
In reality they are true ‘Karmyogis,’ who are selflessly engaged in public service, social service and, above all, in the service to the nation.
Take the case of Abdul Ghafoor Khatri of Gujarat, whohas done an amazing job of reviving the traditional Rogan painting form of Kutch.
He is doing a great job of extending this rare painting art form to the present generation.
I had gifted a Roganpainting titled ‘Tree of Life’ done by Abdul Gafoor, to the former President of USA, Mr. Barack Obama.
Among the recipients of the Padma award, ShabbirSayyed of Marathwada is known as the servant of Gau-Mata.
The manner he has spent his entire life in the service of Gau-mata, is unique in itself.
Generally, very few people associated with the agricultural world or those very few who can be labeled as real farmers have ever found their name in the list of Padmashree awards.
At present, whenever I’m touring, it is my sincere effort to meet people beneficiaries of ‘PMJAY’ scheme under Ayushman Bharat’s umbrella.
I have found that it brings about a transformation in the life of the have-nots.
If you know a poor person who is unable to procure treatment due to lack of money, do inform him about this scheme.
In the next few weeks various education boards across the country will initiate the process for the board examinations of the tenth and twelfth standards.
My best wishes to all the students who’re going to appear for their examinations, their parents and all the teachers as well.
A few weeks ago, an immense event entitled ‘ParikshaPeCharcha’ was organised in Delhi in the format of a Town Hall programme.
In this Town Hall programme, I had the opportunity to talk with crores of students from India and abroad, and also with their parents and teachers; a possibility through the aegis of technology.
And he told me that he could mimic the Prime Minister.
So I requested a demonstration and a pleasant surprise was in store for me.
He mimicked the very exact way I converse with you during ‘Mann KiBaat’.
I was very happy to hear that people not only listen to ‘Mann KI Baat’ but also remember it on many occasions.
I was really impressed with the prowess of that divyang young man.
Through radio I connect every month with millions of families.
Many times while conversing with you, reading your letters or listening to your thoughts sent on the phone, I feel that you have adopted me as part of your family.
This has been a very sublime experience for me.
Friends, elections are the biggest celebration of democracy.
In the next two months, we will be busy in the hurly-burly of the general elections.
I myself will also be a candidate during this election.

Every athlete who represented India at 2018 Commonwealth Games inspires us.
Their life stories illustrate the power of dedication and a never-say-die attitude that made them overcome countless hurdles to attain the heights of success they did at the CWG.
I hope India’s success at 2018 Commonwealth Games motivates more youngsters to pursue sports and creates larger awareness on the importance of fitness in everyone’s lives.

My dear countrymen, Namaskar.
This is the last edition of ‘Mann Ki Baat’ this year and it’s a coincidence that this day happens to be the last day of the year of 2017.
You and I shared many thoughts and ideas the entire year.
Your steady stream of letters to ‘Mann Ki Baat’, your comments, this exchange between minds always infuses new energy in me.
A few hours later, the year will change, but this sequence of our conversation will go on, just the way it is.
We will renew this exchange of thoughts on newer topics in the year to come, we’ll share new experiences.
Heartiest New Year greetings to all of you.
Over the last few days, the festival of Christmas was celebrated across the world with gaiety and fervor.
People in India too celebrated Christmas with warmth and cheer.
The pious occasion of Christmas reminds us of the great teachings of Jesus Christ who laid much emphasis on the spirit of service, ‘Sewa bhaav’.
 
 
 
 
 
Be it any religion, caste or creed, tradition or colour in this world; the spirit of service is an invaluable hallmark of the highest human values.
In our country we refer to ‘NishKaam Karma’, selfless deeds, meaning a service done without any expectations.
My dear countrymen, this year was also the 350th ‘Prakash Parv’ of Guru Gobind Singh ji.
The illustrious life of Guru Gobind Singh ji, full of instances of courage & sacrifice is a source of inspiration to all of us.
Guru Gobind Singh ji preached the virtues of sublime human values and at the same time, practiced them in his own life in letter & spirit.
A guru, a poet, a philosopher, a great warrior, Guru Gobind Singh ji, in all these roles, performed the great task of inspiring people.
He fought against oppression & injustice.
His teachings to people focused on breaking the cordons of caste and religion.
In this endeavour, he stood to lose a lot on his personal front.
But he never let antagonism raise its ugly head in his path.
I’m fortunate that at the beginning of this year, I got an opportunity to participate in the 350th birth anniversary celebration organized at Patna Sahib.
Come, let us all resolve to imbibe & abide by lessons from his great teachings & exemplary life and mould our own life in accordance with them.
The 1st of January, 2018, i.e. tomorrow, in my view, is a special day.
People born in the year 2000 or later; those born in the 21st century will gradually begin to become eligible voters from the 1st of January, 2018.
The Indian Democracy welcomes the voters of the 21st century, the ‘New India Voters’.
I congratulate our youth & urge them to register themselves as voters.
Your vote will prove to be the bedrock of New India.
The power of the vote is the greatest strength of a democracy.
The vote is the most effective tool in bringing about a positive change in the lives of millions of people.
And it’s not just about you acquiring the right to Vote.
I firmly believe that the dream of our ‘New India’ will be realized through the skill & fortitude of these energetic youth.
New India will be a place where peace, unity and amity will be our guiding force.
My New India Youth should come forward and deliberate on how this New India would be formed.
One should decide one’s own path and also decide a way for connecting along those attached to one and the Caravan should get going.
You should move forward and thus should the country move ahead.
I wish that the New India Youth get information and details of all these new opportunities and plans at one place and a system be created so that every young person on turning 18 should automatically get to know all this and benefit from it.
My dear countrymen, I had talked about positivity during the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat.
I am reminded of one Sanskrit Shloka-
This means that a man full of enthusiasm is very strong since there is nothing more powerful than zest.
Nothing is impossible for a man having positivity and zeal.
In English too, it is said, ‘Pessimism leads to weakness, optimism to power’.
During the previous episode of Mann Ki Baat, I had appealed to the countrymen to share their positive moments of 2017 and to welcome 2018 in a positive atmosphere.
I am very glad that a large number of people gave positive responses on social media platform, MyGov and the Narendra Modi App and shared their experiences.
Lakhs of tweets were posted on Positive India hashtag (#), which reached out to more than nearly 150 crore people.
In a way, a wave of positivity which emanated from India spread all over the world.
All tweets and responses received were really inspiring.
It was indeed a delightful experience.
Some countrymen shared those incidents of this year which left a special impact on their minds, a very positive one at that.
Some people even shared their personal achievements.
# My name is Meenu Bhatia.
I reside in Mayur Vihar, Pocket-1, Phase- I, Delhi.
# My name is Jyoti Rajendra Waade.
I am speaking from Bodal.
One rupee per month was being deducted towards insurance premium which my husband had subscribed to.
He died in an accident.
Only we know of the situation we faced at that time.
Assistance from the government helped us a lot and I could gather the strength to stand myself.
# My name is Santosh Jadhav.
A national highway has been constructed in 2017 through our village Bhinnar.
As a result of this, our roads have improved a lot and business there will surely get a boost.
# My name is Satish Bewani.
We had a problem of water scarcity in our area and we used to depend on an army pipeline for the last forty years.
Now an Independent pipeline has been constructed.
So, this is our achievement in 2017.
There are a large number of such persons who have brought in positive transformation in the lives of many people through endeavour at their own level.
In fact, this is the New India which we are all collectively building.
Let us enter into the New Year with such little achievements, begin our New Year and take concrete steps in the journey from ‘Positive India’ to ‘Progressive India’.
When we all talk of positivity, I also feel like sharing one experience.
Recently, I came to know about the inspiring story of Anjum Bashir Khan Khattak who is a topper in Kashmir Administrative Service Examination.
He actually extricated himself from the sting of terrorism and hatred and topped in the Kashmir Administrative Examination.
You will be surprised to know that terrorists had set his ancestral home on fire in 1990.
Terrorism and violence were so widespread there that his family had to leave their ancestral land and flee from there.
For a young child, such an atmosphere of violence could easily create darkness and bitterness in the heart, but Anjum did not let it be so.
He never gave up hope.
He chose a different path for himself – a path of serving the people.
He overcame the adverse situation and scripted his own success story.
Today, he has become a source of inspiration not only in Jammu & Kashmir but for the youth of the whole country.
Anjum has proved that however adverse the circumstances be, the clouds of despair and disappointment can easily be cleared by taking positive steps.
Just last week, I had a chance of meeting some daughters of Jammu & Kashmir.
I was amazed at the spirit that they had, the enthusiasm that was there in their hearts and the dreams they nurtured.
But, Sabrimala temple in itself is an example to show how this challenge could be converted into a sanskar, a habit and what a tremendous strength public participation has!
One police officer P. Vijayan initiated a programme Punyam Poonkavanam and commenced a voluntary campaign of creating awareness on cleanliness.
And, he began a tradition that the yatra of devotees will remain incomplete if they do not contribute by performing some physical labour or the other in the cleanliness programme.
No one is big or small in this campaign.
Every devotee considers doing physical labour in the cleanliness drive as a part of the Lord’s worship.
Every morning, there is a uniquely pleasant scene of cleanliness here when all devotees join in the drive.
However big a celebrity be, or however rich one might be or however high an official be – each one contributes as an ordinary devotee in this Punyan Poonkavanam programme and becomes a part of this cleanliness drive.
There are many such examples before us.
This cleanliness drive in Sabrimala and the contribution of Punyan Poonkavanam in this are so immense that each devotee contributes and participates in it.
Here, a strong resolve of maintaining cleanliness also is as important as the strict discipline observed during worship.
My dear countrymen, all of us made a resolve on Bapu’s birth anniversary on October 2, 2014 to take forward Bapu’s unfinished task of building a ‘Clean India’ and ‘a filth- free India’.
Revered Bapu fought for this cause all through his life and made all out efforts.
And, all of us took a resolve that on the 150th birth anniversary of revered Bapu, we shall make some contribution in the direction of making Clean India which he had dreamt of.
Efforts in the direction of cleanliness are being widely taken across the whole country.
A change can now be seen in the form of public participation in rural and urban areas alike.
Cleanliness Survey 2018, the largest in the world, will be conducted from the 4th of January to 10th of March, 2018 to evaluate achievements in cleanliness level of our urban areas.
This survey will cover a population of more than 40 crores in more than four thousand cities.
During this survey, the matters to be surveyed include freedom from defecation in the open in cities, collection of garbage, transport facilities to lift garbage, processing of garbage using scientific methods, efforts to usher in behavioural changes, innovative steps taken for capacity building to maintain cleanliness and public participation in this campaign.
Separate teams will go to cities for inspection.
They will talk to the people there and gather their reactions.
They will analyse the use of the Cleanliness App and also about bringing reforms and improvements in various kinds of service centres.
It will also be observed whether the cities have created a system wherein cleanliness of cities will became public habit, or the city’s habit for that matter.
It is not for the government alone to maintain cleanliness.
Every citizen and people’s organizations have a big responsibility.
And I appeal to every citizen to actively participate in the Cleanliness Survey to be undertaken in the coming days.
And take the full onus to ensure that your city should not lag behind and your street or mohalla should not look to be wanting.
I am very sure that using blue and green dustbins to collect dry and wet garbage respectively must have become your habit by now.
For waste- collection the principle of reduce, reuse and re-cycle is very effective.
Even in many Islamic countries this practice does not exist.
But Muslim women in India did not have this right.
And I’m glad that our government paid heed to this matter.
Our Ministry of Minority Affairs issued corrective measures and we ameliorated this restriction by phasing out a tradition that had been in practice for the past seventy years.
 
 
 
I not only reiterate this wholeheartedly but it is my firm belief that the journey of India’s progress has been possible due to women-power and on the basis of their talent and we will continue to march onwards on this path of progress.
But 26th January, 2018, will especially be remembered through the ages.
The Republic Day will be celebrated with leaders of all ten ASEAN countries coming to India as Chief Guests.
This time, not one but Ten chief guests would grace the Republic Day.
This is a festival linked with nature.
Though all of our festivals are associated with nature in one way or the other, but in our country blessed with the bounty of cultural diversity, there are different ways to celebrate this wonderful episode of nature in different forms.
Lohdi is celebrated in Punjab and North-India, while UP-Bihar eagerly await for Khichdi and Til-Sankranti.
In Rajasthan, it is called Sankrant, Magh-bihu in Assam and Pongal in Tamil Nadu – all these festivals are special in their own right and they have their own importance.
All of these festivals are usually celebrated between 13th and 17thJanuary.

Ladies and Gentlemen
On the upcoming occasion of the Vilambhi Tamil New Year on April 14th, I extend my warm greetings to all Tamil people across the world.
I am happy to be at Cancer Institute, Adyar.
This is one of the oldest and most significant comprehensive cancer care centers in India.
I am happy to note that proposals for setting up of 15 State Cancer Institutes and 20 Tertiary Care Cancer Centres have been approved so far.14 new All India Institutes of Medical Sciences are being set up, with focus on oncology in its various aspects.
Under the Comprehensive Primary Health Care aspect of Ayushman Bharat, we will provide preventive and curative services at primary care level to people near their homes.
We have initiated Population-based Prevention, Control, Screening and Management of common non-communicable diseases such as Diabetes, Hyper-tension and Common Cancers.
To prevent, control and manage diseases like cancer we need action from all sections of society including NGOs and private sector.
The Cancer Institute W.I.A. Chennai is a voluntary charitable institution, founded by a group voluntary women social workers under the inspiring leadership of the late Dr.Muthulaxmi Reddy.
This institute started as a small cottage hospital.
I am informed that 30 percent of these beds are free beds, which means patients are not charged.
The Union Government is committed to cooperative federalism.
Our mantra is Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas.
Let us all work together to build a New India, which would make our great freedom fighters proud.
At the outset, I apologise for the delay due to logistical reasons.
I am delighted to welcome you all to PETROTECH-2019, the thirteenth edition of India’s flagship hydrocarbon Conference.
I would also like to congratulate His Excellency Dr. Sultan Al Jaber for his contribution to the energy sector and vision for the future.
Over the last quarter century, PETROTECH has served as a platform to discuss solutions to challenges that we face in the energy sector.
Several decades of public life have convinced me that energy is a key driver of socio-economic growth.
Suitably priced, stable and sustainable energy supply, is essential for rapid growth of the economy.
It also helps the poor and deprived sections of society, to partake of economic benefits.
At the macro level, the energy sector is a pivot and key enabler of growth.
Energy supply, energy sources and energy consumption patterns are changing.
Perhaps, this could be a historic transition.
There is a shift in energy consumption from West to East.
The United States has become the world’s largest oil and gas producer after the shale revolution.
Natural Gas is fast becoming one of the largest fuels in the global energy mix.
Nations are coming together to tackle climate change.
This is visible in global partnerships, such as the International Solar Alliance, promoted by India and France.
We are entering an era of greater energy availability.
But more than a billion people across the globe still do not have access to electricity.
People must have universal access to clean, affordable, sustainable and equitable supply of energy.
We have adopted an integrated approach towards energy planning.
During the last PETROTECH Conference in December 2016, I mentioned four pillars for India’s energy future.
These are energy access, energy efficiency, energy sustainability and energy security.
Energy justice is also a key objective for me, and a top priority for India.
Towards this end, we have developed and implemented many policies.
The results of these efforts are now evident.
Electricity has reached all our rural areas.
This year we aim to achieve hundred per cent electrification of households in India, through a targeted programme called SAUBHAGYA.
As we raise production, we also aim to reduce losses in transmission and distribution.
Under our UDAY scheme, we are working towards this objective.
India’s World Bank Ease of Getting Electricity Ranking, improved from one hundred and eleven in 2014 to twenty-nine in 2018.
LED bulbs distributed across the country under the UJALA scheme, have resulted in an annual saving of seventeen thousand crore rupees, or nearly 2.5 billion dollars.
A ‘Blue Flame Revolution’ is underway.
LPG coverage has reached more than ninety percent, from fifty-five percent five years ago.
Clean Transportation is getting a boost.
We are jumping directly from BS four to BS six fuel by April 2020.
This is the equivalent of EURO six standards.
Achievements such as hundred percent electrification, and increased LPG coverage, are possible only through people’s involvement.
Energy justice can be done only when people believe in their collective power.
Government is only an enabler in converting that belief into a reality.
The last five years have seen major reforms in India’s oil and gas sector.
We have revamped our upstream policies and regulations.
We have launched the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy to bring transparency and competitiveness in the sector.
The bidding criterion has been changed to revenue sharing.
Gas pricing reforms have also been introduced.
The Enhanced Oil Recovery Policy aims to promote the use of latest technology in improving productivity of upstream fields.
Our downstream sector has been completely liberalized.
Market driven petrol and diesel prices reflect changes in the international price of crude oil.
India has the fourth largest refining capacity in the world.
This will further grow by about 200 million metric tons by 2030.
A National Biofuel Policy was enacted last year.
The ethanol blending and biodiesel programme is reducing carbon emissions, and raising farmers’ incomes.
Bio Aviation Turbine Fuel has already been tried out in our civil aviation sector.
Our government has encouraged private participation across the entire oil and gas value chain.
India is becoming an attractive FDI destination.
Companies like Saudi Aramco, ADNOC, TOTAL, Exxon-Mobil, BP and Shell are looking to increase their investments across the value chain.
Execution of three thousand, two hundred kilometers of gas pipeline in Eastern India has begun.
This will connect North East India with the National Gas Grid.
The tenth bid round for City Gas Distribution will be complete in a month’s time.
This will cover over four hundred districts.
It will extend coverage of City Gas Distribution to seventy percent of our population.
Our companies are adopting latest technologies to improve efficiency, increase safety and reduce costs.
This is being done in downstream retail, as well as in upstream oil and gas production, asset maintenance and remote monitoring.
In recent years, we have deepened our international engagement with organizations such as the International Energy Agency, and OPEC.
We chaired the International Energy Forum from 2016 to 2018.
We have been able to convert our traditional buyer-seller engagements into strategic partnerships through bilateral investments.
We have also promoted our ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy by strengthening energy engagement with Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Myanmar.
I have regularly engaged with global CEOs from the oil and gas sector.
In my interactions with world leaders and CEOs, I have always maintained that Oil and Gas are not only a commodity of trade but also of necessity.
Whether it is for the kitchen of a common man or for an aircraft, energy is essential.
For too long, the world has seen crude prices on a roller-coaster.
We need to move to responsible pricing, which balances the interests of both the producer and consumer.
We also need to move towards transparent and flexible markets for both oil and gas.
Only then can we serve the energy needs of humanity in an optimal manner.
Another key issue that needs the world to come together is climate change.
Together, we can achieve the targets we set for ourselves at COP-21 in Paris.
India has made rapid strides in meeting its commitment.
We are on our way to reaching the target.

I am sure, it shall be of mutual benefit to investors, innovators, think-tanks and other stakeholders from across the world.
I am sure, it shall encourage you to visit other parts of India as well.
Indeed, India is home to ancient, rich and diverse cultures, through which runs an under-lying theme of unity.

Your Excellency Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
It is a great pleasure to welcome Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, on his first ever visit to India.
(My good friend, Welcome to India!)
Your visit, Prime Minister, is a long-anticipated moment in the journey of friendship between India and Israel.
Your visit is also a fitting climax to the comemoration of 25 years of diplomatic relations between India and Israel.
As our first honoured guest in 2018, your visit marks a special beginning to our New Year calendar.
It comes at an especially auspicious time as people all over India are rejoicing the arrival of spring, renewal, hope and harvest.
The festivals of Lohri, Bihu, MakarSankranti, and Pongal celebrate the splendour of India’s diversity and unity.
And it is a measure of our shared ambition and commitment that six short months after that visit; your extraordinary visit is taking place to India.
Today and yesterday, Prime Minister Netanyahu and I reviewed the progress in our relations and renewed our conversation on the possibilities and the opportunities that beckon us and need to be seized.
Prime Minister, I have a reputation of being impatient in getting results.
If I may let out an open secret, I know that so are you.
Last year in Tel Aviv, you had expressed the intent to cut down bureaucratic red tape with a machete and forge ahead with speed.
 
 
 
· First, we will strengthen the existing pillars of cooperation in areas that touch the lives of our peoples.
These are agriculture, science and technology, and security.
We exchanged views on scaling up the Centers of Excellence that have been a main-stay of agricultural cooperation by bringing in advanced Israeli practices and technology.
In defence, I have invited Israeli companies to take advantage of the liberalized FDI regime to make more in India with our companies.
You will find this reflected in the agreements that were just exchanged.
Several of these areas are indicative of our desire to diversify and broad-base engagement.
It requires policy facilitation, infrastructure and connectivity links and fostering constituencies of support beyond Government.
We have also decided to start an annual exchange of bilateral visits by 100 young people from science-related educational streams.
Thriving two-way trade and investment is an integral part of our vision for a strong partnership.
Prime Minister Netanyahu and I agreed on the need to do more in this direction.
After the meeting in Tel Aviv last year, we will interact for the second time with our CEOs under the bilateral Forum.
I welcome the large business component that Prime Minister Netanyahu has brought along with him.
Prime Minister Netanyahu and I also exchanged perspectives on the regional and global situation.
We reviewed our cooperation as a factor for stability and peace in our regions and the world.
Yesterday, as his first stop after touching Indian soil, Prime Minister Netanyahu joined me at the re-named Teen Murti Haifa Chowk to pay homage to the memory of the brave Indian soldiers who laid down their lives a century ago in the Battle of Haifa in Israel.
As we look to the future of this exciting partnership with Israel, I am filled with hope and optimism.
In Prime Minister Netanyahu, I have a counter-part who is equally committed to taking the India-Israel relationship to soaring new heights.
Finally, I am delighted to have the chance to be with you, Prime Minister , in my home state, Gujarat, day after.
There, we will have another opportunity to see the fulfillment of the promise, which our mutual cooperation holds in diverse areas such as agriculture, technology, and innovation.
I wish Prime Minister Netanyahu, Mrs. Netanyahu and the delegation a memorable stay in India.
Thank you very much.

In India, we are also focused on making our growth inclusive.
It is for this reason that we have taken strong initiatives for financial inclusion.

That is our commitment to a green and sustainable future.
Economic progress is closely tied to world-class infrastructure.
Be it Transport, Power, Ports, Shipbuilding, Housing and Urban Infrastructure, there is huge demand in India while there are strong technological capabilities and capacities in Korea.
We estimate the investment requirements in Infrastructure at over 700 billion Dollars by 2022.
In this regard, we have introduced flagship program Start-up India with 1.4 billion Dollars fund for four years to create a startup ecosystem in India.
Our vision of an India-Korea Startup Centre – will provide a hub for Korean startups and Indian talent to freely communicate.

In the field of innovation, both countries have decided to establish ‘India-Korea Future Strategy Group’ and ‘India-Korea Centre for research and Innovation Cooperation’ to provide an institutional framework for future-oriented cooperation based on research, innovation and entrepreneurship.
It is our earnest desire to work with Republic of Korea more closely to realize the dream of our citizens.

Welcome to India.
As you come together today to discuss the future of global energy,the world is seeing a great transition in energy supply and consumption.
• Consumption growth has shifted to non OECD countries: Middle East, Africa and developing Asia;
• Solar Photo-Voltaic energy has become economical compared to all other energy sources.
This is changing the supply paradigm (पैरा-डाइम);
• Abundant availability of natural gas globally with increased percentage of LNG and natural gas is contributing to the primary energy basket;
• Coal may gradually go out of favour as a major contributor to primary energy in the OECD World and later in developing countries;
• The Transport sector will see massive changes in the next few decades with adoption of electric vehicles;
• The World is committedto the climate change agendabased on the COP-21agreement.
The energy intensity of economies will change with focus on green energy and energy efficiency;
Let me share with you some of my thoughtson the hydrocarbon sector and our endeavourto achieve energy security.
Oil and Gas are a commodity of tradebut also of necessity.
Whether it is for the kitchen of a common manor for an aircraft,energy is essential.
The world has for too long seen prices on a roller-coaster.
If the world has to grow as a whole,there has to be a mutually supportive relationship between producers and consumers.
It is in the interests of producersthat other economies keep growing steadily and rapidly.
This will ensure growing energy markets for them.
Efforts at artificially distorting prices are self-defeating,as history has shown us.
They also cause undue hardships,particularly to those at the bottom of the pyramid in developing and least developed countries.
Energy in general and hydrocarbons in particularare an important part of my vision for India’s future.
Currently,India is the fastest growing large economy in the world.
All leading agencies such as IMF, World Bank, and ADB are estimating India to grow at 7 to 8 percent in the near future.
Universal access to modern energy by 2030;
Urgent action to tackle climate change – in line with the Paris agreement;
Measures to improve air quality;
We believe access to clean cooking fuelis very important to improve standards of living.
Women benefit the most from it.
In India, throughthe UjjwalaYojana we provide free LPG connections to women from poorhouseholds.
We have also launched a vehicle scrapping policywhich will help replace old vehicles with cleaner and energy efficient vehicles.
Our oil companies are assessing all their investmentskeeping in view the energy diversification strategies.
Today, oil companies are also investing in wind and solar capacities,gas infrastructure,and also thinking in the direction of investing in Electric Vehicle and Storage areas.
As we are all aware, we are now looking towards Industry 4.0, proposing to change the way industry operates in the future with new technologies and processes like Internet of Things, Artificial intelligence, robotics process automation, machine learning, predictive analytics, 3-D printing, etc.
The theme of IEF-16 is “The Future of Global Energy Security.”

Major Impact including employment generation potential:
It will also provide indirect employment/ entrepreneurial opportunities in the field of transportation, tourism and other small scale businesses.

Besides being environment friendly, hydropower has several other unique features like ability for quick ramping, black start, reactive absorption etc. which make it ideal for peaking power, spinning reserve and grid balancing/ stability.
Further, hydropower also provides water security, irrigation and flood moderation benefits, apart from socio-economic development of the entire region by providing employment opportunities and boosting tourism etc.
The importance of hydropower is increasing even more as the country has targeted to add 160 GW of intermittent Solar and Wind power by 2022 and 40% of the total capacity from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030 to honour its Nationally Determined Contribution for Climate Change.
